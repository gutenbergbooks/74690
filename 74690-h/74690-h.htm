<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br>

<small>THE SLUG</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">FOUR boys, ranging from eleven to fifteen years of
age, squatted close to earth in a wet, weed-rank city
lot. It was spring, and the new warmth of the
season’s birth was in the air. The lot was a vacant one,
and perhaps would remain so for many years to come, because
it was low, and the spring rains had made of it a
veritable swamp.</p>

<p>One boy was master of ceremonies, and the eager eyes
of his companions were fixed on a chip of wood that he
held in his hand, four inches above the ground. The chip
was perhaps five inches square, and over it crawled a slug,
a slimy, repulsive, helpless creature of the earth. <i>Limax
Campestris</i> was the slug’s rather important-sounding name,
but of this the boys knew nothing.</p>

<p>“Aw, bet ye an agut he can’t get down!” volunteered
one boy.</p>

<p>“Which one o’ yere agates?” asked the one who held
the chip.</p>

<p>“My ole moony one,” was the reply. “Bet ye my moony
agut against yer black-’n’-white one!”</p>

<p>“Aw, his black-an’-white one’s half glass,” put in a
would-be spoilsport.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>To show that he accepted the wager, the black-haired boy
who had imprisoned the slug on the chip reached his right
hand into his trousers pocket and laid a white-and-black-striped
agate marble on the ground beside him. The tow-headed
gambler who had offered the wager laid beside the
black-and-white marble a milky-colored one, which was soft
and showed tiny half-moons, the result of countless collisions
with other “taws.”</p>

<p>“Anybody else?” invited the boy who held the chip and
its crawling inhabitant.</p>

<p>Several bets were offered, ranging from so many “chinies”
or “commies” or “glassies” to collections of jack-stones
and other treasures dear to the heart of a boy, all
of which the master of ceremonies accepted to the extent
of his pockets’ contents. All eyes were again fixed on the
slowly moving gastropod.</p>

<p>“Now, lissen, Cole,” said one. “Ye’re bettin’ he c’n git
down offen that chip ’thout jumpin’, eh? Is that it?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied the dark-haired boy.</p>

<p>“Er fallin’?” questioned another.</p>

<p>“Er fallin’ either,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Aw, they’s a ketch in it somewheres, fellas,” was the
warning of the third youthful sportsman. “He’ll let the
chip down er somethin’.”</p>

<p>“They ain’t any such thing,” retorted the boy called
Cole. “I’m bettin’just like what I said. This here slug’ll
let ’imself down on the ground an’ go on about his business
’thout me helpin’ ’im, er him jumpin’ er fallin’ er
anything like that. An’ I’ll keep the chip four inches
above the ground all the time, just like I got her now. Now
you watch what I’m tellin’ you! Watch ’im!”</p>

<p>“Aw, ye’re crazy!” derided the tow-headed boy. “Ye’re
crazy, Cole!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>The boy called Cole made no reply to this, but kept his
fine gray eyes on his captive.</p>

<p>A studious observer would have noted this boy’s remarkable
face. His hair was coal-black and of heavy growth.
In sharp contrast, his large eyes were a deep gray, almost
blue, and the lashes that covered them were long and black
as soot. The face was decidedly ascetic, the nose thin and
almost Grecian. One noticed the mouth. It was youthful
still, but even now there were settling about it faint traceries
that bespoke determination. His was the face, almost,
of a youth of twenty. But he had barely turned fourteen.</p>

<p>Joshua Cole was the boy’s name. His schoolmates called
him Cole, not because of his precocious gravity, but after
the manner of boys of the age of twelve or thereabout as
they begin to assume the ways of men. When they called
him Josh they were in a frivolous mood and set on teasing
him. But teasing Joshua Cole was fruitless. He merely
smiled and looked steadily at his would-be tormentors out
of his tolerant, grave gray eyes—eyes at the same time so
serious and so whimsical as to baffle them to silence. A
strange boy was Joshua Cole, always deep in some original,
boyish experiment, as in the present instance, but universally
liked by his associates.</p>

<p>“We gotta be gettin’ to school,” Towhead announced,
after the four had watched the circular progress of the slug
in silence for a time.</p>

<p>“Gee whiz! There goes the second bell now!”</p>

<p>“C’m’on, Cole! Ole Madmallet won’t do a thing to us!”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute,” said Joshua Cole softly. “He’s gone
pretty near round the chip now. When he gets clean back
to where he started from, you fellas might’s well say
good-by to yer ole marbles.”</p>

<p>“But I ain’t gonta be tardy!” expostulated Towhead,
and grabbed up the moony agate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>“All right. Go ahead. You’re a hot sport, you are!”</p>

<p>“Ne’mind, Cole. Wait’ll Ole Hothatchet grabs you by
the neck!”</p>

<p>So saying, Towhead ran off toward the near-by brick
schoolhouse, where already the scholars were filing in to the
time of the principal’s tapping with a ruler on a window
sill.</p>

<p>Two more of the boys grabbed up their marbles and
strapped books, and followed Towhead, oblivious to the fate
of the imprisoned slug.</p>

<p>But one doggedly remained with the experimenter. And
this one, too, was a black-haired boy, Joshua’s younger
brother Lester. Lester Cole had made his bet that the
slug could not reach the ground after Joshua had lifted
him from his earthly home on the chip; and the Coles were
famous as stickers. He set his lips and watched the slug
intently. But presently he said:</p>

<p>“Aw, le’s be gettin’ to school, Josh! Old Madmallet’ll
raise the devil. We c’n watch an ole slug any ole time.”</p>

<p>“No, we can’t. Don’t know when we’ll find another
slug,” replied his brother. “It’s gettin’ so hot we won’t
see many more of ’em pretty soon. They can’t stand hot
weather; it kills ’em. But you take yer ole marbles and
go. I don’t care about any ole bet. I’m gonta stay an’
watch this ole slug, myself. Can’t tell when I’ll get another
chance.”</p>

<p>“I won’t go ’less you do, Josh,” said Lester. “You
can’t bluff me out on any ole bet. D’ye think I’m scared
o’ Ole Madhouse? Not on yer life!”</p>

<p>“Look! Look!” Joshua almost shouted. “Now watch
’im, Les! Looky—he’s been all ’round the chip, reachin’
out his feelers and crawlin’ over the edge, ain’t he? And
now he knows he can’t get off the chip just by crawlin’ er
anything like that. Now watch what he’ll do!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>Lester glanced nervously at the brick schoolhouse, into
which the tail end of the cue of scholars was now marching.
Then an excited cry from his brother caused him to
turn his eyes on the slug once more.</p>

<p>And, lo and behold, the brainless crawling thing had
begun to prove that Nature had endowed it with powers
unknown to ordinary, unobservant man. It had crawled
almost entirely over the edge of the chip, and was holding
by the tip end of its tail.</p>

<p>“He’s gonta fall!” cried Lester, forgetting austere old
Silvanus Madmallet, the teacher.</p>

<p>“No, he ain’t! You watch, Les! Now! Look at ’im!”</p>

<p>And lo and behold again, a thin stream of slime came
from a gland at the rear end of the pitiful creature, and
it descended slowly, head down, reeling out its rope of
mucus as it went.</p>

<p>Lester Cole watched in boyish awe as the poor earthling
drew nearer and nearer to the ground, the string of mucus
ever lengthening above it.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t think it ud hold ’im,” he marveled.</p>

<p>And then the slug reached the earth and began slowly
assuming a horizontal position.</p>

<p>“Lift ’im up again, Josh,” suggested Lester.</p>

<p>“No,” said Joshua, dropping the chip. “That wouldn’t
be fair. You lose, kid!”—and he scraped into his hand an
assortment of “glassies” and “chinies.” “C’m’on—we
gotta be gettin’ there!”</p>

<p>Side by side the brothers ran toward the schoolhouse.</p>

<p>“You oughtn’t to’ve stayed, Les,” puffed Joshua.</p>

<p>“An’ how ’bout you?” Lester retorted.</p>

<p>“It’s different with me,” stated Joshua.</p>

<p>“Like the dickens it is! What d’ye mean?”</p>

<p>“I gotta kinda look at things like that. You don’t care
nothin’ about ’em, much. But don’t you let Ole Sorehammer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
get you. You been tardy a lot here lately. He’ll
feel like bustin’ you wide open. But I’ll stick with you.
Don’t let him bluff ye, kid.”</p>

<p>“How’d ye know that thing could do that, Josh?” asked
Lester.</p>

<p>“’Cause I’ve made ’em do it before now,” Joshua told
him.</p>

<p>“You’re a devil of a kid—always doin’ somethin’ like
that.”</p>

<p>“I like to,” was all that Joshua said in explanation.</p>

<p>Silvanus Madmallet, called variously by the boys “Ole
Hothatchet,” “Ole Sorehammer,” or “Ole Madhouse,”
was a tall, long-beaked, austere pedagogue, who fairly
exuded scholastic dignity. He was of the old school—not
so old in that day, either—who dispensed learning under the
well-known maxim, “Spare the rod and spoil the child.”</p>

<p>He was seated at his desk when Joshua and Lester Cole
hurried on tiptoe into the cloak room, deposited their caps
on hooks, and, grinning guiltily at each other, walked into
the classroom and tried to appear unconcerned. Their classmates
giggled and looked in Pharisaic triumph at one another
as the two culprits found their desks and screwed
themselves into the seats behind them. “Behold these publicans,”
said their eyes, “for they are tardy, and we were
not!”</p>

<p>Old Silvanus Madmallet maintained a severe and portentous
silence until the brothers were established in their
seats, casting sheepish glances at each other, not daring to
face the despot on the platform or the hypocritically condemnatory
eyes of their classmates. Then suddenly Old
Madmallet spoke.</p>

<p>“Joshua and Lester Cole, why are you tardy?”</p>

<p>Neither brother volunteered an explanation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>“This has been occurring altogether too frequently of
late,” went on the stern voice of old Silvanus. “Speak
out, Joshua!”</p>

<p>Joshua parted his lips.</p>

<p>“Stand up, sir!” came from the rostrum.</p>

<p>Grinning in embarrassment, the older brother took his
stand.</p>

<p>“It was my fault, Mr. Madmallet,” he confessed.
“Lester, he wasn’t to blame. I kep’ him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, <i>you</i> kept him!” The principal’s tones were sarcastic.
“And did you find it hard to do?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. That is—yes, sir. He—he didn’t want to
stay.”</p>

<p>“That’s a falsehood, Joshua Cole,” said Madmallet in
calm, assured tones. “This is not the first time you have
tried to shield your brother. He has been tardy repeatedly.
Your brotherly love may perhaps be commendatory, but
this time it will not prevent your brother from being punished.”</p>

<p>Silvanus Madmallet seemed to derive great pleasure from
talking, in a measure, over his charges’ heads. He loved to
roll big words over his tongue. Pedantic in the extreme
was old Silvanus Madmallet, else he would have risen long
ago to some form of public service above the teaching of
adolescent girls and boys.</p>

<p>“Lester, stand up!”</p>

<p>Lester squirmed out of his seat and stood erect.</p>

<p>“Go into the hall.”</p>

<p>With slow steps and a white face, the younger brother
took up his melancholy march to the torture room.</p>

<p>“Joshua, sit down!”</p>

<p>But Joshua Cole remained standing. “Looky here, Mr.
Madmallet,” he said, his lips twitching and the jaw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
muscles shuttling under the taut skin of his cheeks, “don’t
you whip my brother. It was me that made him late for
school. You whip me, if ye gotta whip somebody.”</p>

<p>The room was silence itself. There came only the faint
shuffle of Lester’s feet as he walked to his doom. Gray
crags grew over the fiery eyes of old Silvanus Madmallet,
and the eyes glared at Joshua Cole.</p>

<p>“Sit down!” he thundered.</p>

<p>“I know what you’re tryin’ to do!” cried Joshua. “You
know it’ll hurt me more if you whip my brother than
’twould if you was to whip me. You’ve done that before.
I’m onto you. And I won’t stand it!”</p>

<p>His voice had risen with every sentence, and on the
last it broke. Joshua Cole was near to tears. He was at
once angry and frightened at his own audacity. But he
had long been at war with his teacher and knew the injustice
of the man.</p>

<p>“I won’t stand it!” he cried hotly again. “You just
take it out on me by whippin’ Lester. And—and I just
won’t stand it, that’s all!”</p>

<p>“Sit down!” thundered from the platform a second time.</p>

<p>Lester’s lagging steps had brought him to the hall door.
Reluctantly he laid a hand on the knob.</p>

<p>“Go into the hall, I told you, Lester!” said the teacher,
glancing toward him briefly.</p>

<p>Lester opened the door, all hope gone, and closed it
behind him.</p>

<p>“Now, Joshua Cole, are you going to obey me? Once
more—sit down!”</p>

<p>“I won’t set down!” said Joshua, pale as death, but in
his blue-gray eyes that light of unshakable resolve which
was later to prove the determining factor in his career.</p>

<p>Just what might be gained by his refusal to sit down
Joshua did not know. He was not reasoning at all; he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
merely in revolt against a long-standing tyranny. And,
boylike, he had resorted to unreasoning obstinacy to show
his attitude.</p>

<p>For a silent moment Silvanus Madmallet glared at him,
his own face white and rigid. Then he arose briskly, went
to the closet, and returned with a leather strap.</p>

<p>“I will attend to you later, young man,” he said with
cold calmness, and passed through the door by which Lester
Cole had entered the hall.</p>

<p>As the door closed behind him a low buzzing arose in the
classroom. But it ceased abruptly as the scholars saw
Joshua Cole trotting toward that door, his small fists
doubled. And as he passed the big stove, which had not
yet been taken down because of an occasional cold spring
morning, he grasped up the iron poker that leaned so invitingly
in a corner of the coal-box.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br>

<small>SPAWN OF THE DEVIL</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">SILVANUS MADMALLET had long considered
Joshua Cole a child of the evil one. While the
boy seemed intelligent enough, he was in the main
behind in his school work. His brother, aged eleven, was
in the same class, with Joshua fourteen. He was all sufficient
as to “readin’ and writin’,” but when it came to the
third grim specter in that detestable trio, “’rithmetic,”
Joshua simply was the dumbest of the dumb. Geography
and history seemed to hold his attention to a mild degree,
but he detested grammar and all its works. Madmallet’s
futile endeavor to pound arithmetic into young Joshua’s
head was perhaps the opening gun in the feud that existed
between them. Why, what could anybody ever expect to
amount to if he did not have a sound understanding of
arithmetic? Once a week the class had composition; and,
though Joshua’s efforts were always above the average and
showed good sentence construction and thought, they
brought no praise from Madmallet. What matter if the
boy wrote well if he could not parse and diagram a sentence,
and knew no rules of grammar?</p>

<p>One day Madmallet had unraveled a part of the mystery
that shrouded the boy’s shortcomings. Slipping up behind
young Joshua, he had surprised him in holding behind his
large geography a smaller book, upon which his attention
was riveted. Madmallet had snatched away the forbidden
fruit, and his craggy brows had come down as he glared
at the unfamiliar title. Joshua had been reading Proctor’s
<i>Other Worlds Than Ours</i>!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>Madmallet had no sympathy for Science. He was a
firm believer that in six days the Lord made heaven and
earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and he carried his
convictions to extremes. He sent the book home to Joshua’s
father, who cared for neither Science nor its enemies, but
believed that a pupil should not antagonize his teachers,
and promptly punished Joshua by holding him with his
head submerged in a tub of water until the boy was all
but drowned.</p>

<p>One thing had led to another until Madmallet nursed a
personal antipathy for young Joshua. Many times he had
punished him, but the boy had proved so obstinate that
never a cry could his persecutor wring from his twitching
lips. Then Madmallet had learned of Joshua’s rare brotherly
love for Lester, who was himself a prodigious sinner
and committed more crimes against the canons of the school
than did Joshua. So, unable to bend the older brother to
his will, he tortured Lester, well knowing in his cunning
and cruel old heart that he thus punished Joshua more
thoroughly than he could with cane or strap.</p>

<p>And so had the feud progressed until that morning when
Joshua turned upon his tormentor and followed him into
the hall, the blacksmith-made poker gripped in his
trembling hands.</p>

<p>“Take off your coat,” Madmallet was saying, when
the door opened softly behind him and Joshua came
through.</p>

<p>“Keep yer coat on, Les,” ordered Joshua in shaky tones.
Then he turned his grave gray-blue eyes on the teacher,
and laid the poker over his right shoulder. “Du-don’t you
hit my brother with that strap,” he said; and, though
his tones showed nervousness, even fear, they contained a
quality that gave Madmallet pause.</p>

<p>His face grew fiery red and his cheeks puffed out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>“You threaten me with that poker, you young scoundrel!”
he bellowed. “Me! You threaten <i>me</i>!”</p>

<p>“Ye heard what I said!”—the tones grew stronger.
“You hit my brother with that strap an’ I’ll bust your
head with this poker.”</p>

<p>Silvanus Madmallet stood in a statuesque position and
gazed in horrified amazement at the boy. Could this thing
be? Had he heard aright? Would even the most incorrigible
pupil in his room dare to go as far as this?</p>

<p>He clinched his teeth, drew back the strap, and took
one step toward the cowering Lester. Then the iron poker
left the shoulder of young Joshua, and the boy’s elbows
traveled farther back to gain impetus for a deadly blow.
Madmallet paled, dropped the uplifted arm, and stepped
safely out of reach. In that moment Joshua knew that he
faced an utter coward, and his soul cried out in triumph.</p>

<p>“Don’t hit ’im, I tell ye!” he said gloatingly. He knew
that this repetition was unnecessary, but he had to crow
over his victory and could think of nothing else to say.</p>

<p>Madmallet took one more step toward safety, then leveled
a long, bony finger.</p>

<p>“You, Joshua Cole, are expelled,” he said. “Go home
and tell your parents.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care,” retorted Joshua. “You c’n expel me
if ye want to, but you ain’t gonta hit my brother with
that strap.”</p>

<p>“Go home! Get your hat and your books and go!”</p>

<p>“Not unless Les goes with me. You ain’t gonta send me
home, and keep Les here to beat ’im up soon’s I’m gone.”</p>

<p>“You’re the devil’s spawn!” raged Madmallet. “You’ll
die on the gallows!—you’re a born criminal!—I’m expelling
you for the good of the school!—to save the rest of my
pupils from your evil influence! I hope your father—kills
you. Will you go?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>But Joshua stood firm. Then Madmallet threw up his
hands and rolled his eyes toward heaven. He seemed to
derive inspiration from the process, for he turned to Lester,
and, cheeks vibrating with anger, ordered him:</p>

<p>“Go home—you, too! <i>You’re</i> suspended for a week.
I’ll write a letter to your father about this unbelievable
insolence. Go—both of you! Out of my sight!”</p>

<p>And with this he hurried toward the door, keeping a wide
space between his precious self and the poker-bearer, and
dodged into the classroom.</p>

<p>“N-now ye’ve done it!” blubbered Lester, casting a reproachful
look at his champion.</p>

<p>“Shut up!” ordered his brother. “Go get our caps.
We’ll let the confounded ole books go. Le’s hurry up an’
get outa this.”</p>

<p>“Father’ll drown us,” wailed Lester, but he obeyed his
brother and came back presently from the cloak room, both
caps in hand.</p>

<p>Joshua crowded his on his head, laid the poker against
the stair rail, and descended almost noiselessly ahead of
Lester. Downstairs and out in the bright spring sunshine
he still took the lead, while Lester, sobbing brokenly,
trudged along behind him. They left the school ground and
made toward the vacant lot where the rank weeds grew.</p>

<p>“Wh-where ye goin’, Josh?” sniffled the younger one.</p>

<p>“What’s the diff where we go? We dassent go home.
I’m gonta see if I c’n find that slug again. I’ll show ye
somethin’ else he c’n do that ye never dreamed of.”</p>

<p>“I don’t wanta see no ole slug, Joshua! What’re we
gonta do? You—you jest ruined everythin’! Father’ll
drown us, I tell ye! An’ all on your account!”</p>

<p>“Won’t drown me,” replied Joshua doggedly. “Me,
I’m through with that drowndin’ business. Father’ll never
stick my head in a tub o’ water again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>“But what’ll you do to keep ’im from doin’ it? Oh, I
tell ye he’ll—”</p>

<p>“Shut up! You gi’me a pain, Les! I’m goin’ out West—that’s
why he won’t drown me. You’re goin’ with me.”</p>

<p>“I ain’t! I won’t!”</p>

<p>“Then stay here and get drowned,” said Joshua heartlessly.</p>

<p>They had by this time entered the swampy vacant lot
where, such a short time before, Joshua had paraded to the
betterment of his pockets’ contents the marvelous endowment
of <i>Limax Campestris</i>. Joshua’s eyes were dry, but
his face was pallid, for he knew only too well the gravity
of the situation. But he sought for and found the selfsame
slug, crawling over a broad leaf and feasting thereon.
And at once his gray-blue eyes lighted up, and thoughts of
his troubles vanished.</p>

<p>“Say, Les,” he said, “you stay here while I go home
and sneak Father’s razor. I’ll be right back—honest, I
will.”</p>

<p>“What d’ye want of a razor?” asked the brother petulantly.</p>

<p>“Ne’mind. I’ll tell Mother I forgot a book and hadta
come home f’r it. But she won’t see me, maybe. I’ll sneak
in the back door, an’ Zida’ll never tell on me. Mother was
goin’ ridin’ this mornin’, anyway.”</p>

<p>“But what’re we gonta do, Josh?” wailed Lester again,
as Joshua started away.</p>

<p>“Aw, ferget that, can’t ye! We’re goin’ West, I tell
ye! You leave everything to me, Les.”</p>

<p>“You got me into this, an’—”</p>

<p>But Joshua was running and paid no further heed; and
Lester threw himself upon the damp ground and gave his
misery full swing.</p>

<p>Zida Hunt, the Coles’ negro cook and maid of all work,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
was a friend of the erring Joshua. As the boy entered
the kitchen of the big brick house which the Coles called
home she turned toward him and lifted high her hands.
Zida was given to emotionalism on the slightest provocation.</p>

<p>“Lord, chile, what yo’-all doin’ home dis time o’ day?”</p>

<p>“I forgot one o’ my books, Zida, an’ Ole Madhouse sent
me home to get it,” lied the boy. “Where’s Mother?”</p>

<p>“She done gone out ridin’ in de kerrige,” Zida told him.</p>

<p>“Well, don’t say nothin’, will ye, Zida? About me bein’
sent home, you know. They ain’t any use to, now, is
there?”</p>

<p>“Suttingly not, chile. Go on up to yo’ room an’ git yo’
book. Ah ain’t gonta say nothin’ about hit.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, Zida”—and Joshua hurried through the dining
room to the front hall, where he leaped upstairs three
steps at a time.</p>

<p>Here he was safe, so he made at once for his father’s
room, searched the dresser drawers, found the cased razor,
and went downstairs once more. He left the house by the
front door so that Zida might not see that he carried no
book. He hurried along Grant Avenue to the corner, then
followed a side street to the vacant lot where his heartsick
brother awaited him.</p>

<p>“Where’s that ole slug now?” was Joshua’s beginning.
“I got the ole razor, all right, all right.”</p>

<p>Lester sat up and continued to sniffle, uninterested in the
razor and the slug and any combination that might be
arranged between them.</p>

<p>The feasting slug had not moved from the broad leaf,
and Joshua sat down on the ground beside it and removed
the razor from its case.</p>

<p>“Gee, it’s sharp!” he announced. “Le’me spit on yer
arm an’ shave the hair offen it, kid.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t want ye to,” said Lester. “I don’t know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
how you c’n be that way, when you know as well as I do
what’s gonta be done to us.”</p>

<p>“What way?”</p>

<p>“Thinkin’ about things like ye’re always doin’—that’s
how! Ye better be thinkin’ about what’s gonta happen to
us when the folks gets Ole Sorehammer’s letter.”</p>

<p>“They ain’t gonta get any letter from Ole Sorehammer,
kid. Don’t you worry about that. C’m’on now an’ watch
this ole slug do somethin’ funny. What ye got to bet that
he can’t walk the tight rope along the edge o’ this razor
’thout cuttin’ ’imself?”</p>

<p>“I ain’t got nothin’ to bet, and I don’t care what he c’n
do! Why won’t our folks get Madmallet’s letter, Josh?”</p>

<p>“’Cause I won’t let ’em, that’s why. Don’t ye know
who Madmallet’ll send home with that letter?”</p>

<p>“O’ course—ole Slinky Dawson, teacher’s pet.”</p>

<p>“Course it’ll be Slinky Dawson. An’ that’s just why
I’m hangin’ out here in this ole lot. Won’t ole Slinky hafta
cross this lot on the way to our house? An’ we’ll be hidin’
here, an’ when he comes along we’ll scare the stuffin’ outa
him. I’ll tell ’im that if he takes that letter to our folks
I’ll knock the waddin’ outa him. Say, he’ll be scared to
death, Les. You leave that little mamma’s boy to your
Uncle Josh—I’ll fix his ole clock! C’m’on, now—bet ye
anythin’ ye wanta bet this here ole slug c’n walk from one
end to the other o’ this ole razor blade an’ not cut ’imself
a little bit. C’m’on, Les—be a sport! What’s the use
actin’ like you are—that don’t get you nothin’!”</p>

<p>Lester rubbed the tears from his eyes with a dirty wrist
and, encouraged by the positive tone in his brother’s promises,
allowed his curiosity to arise over the possibilities of a
razor-walking slug. He went close to Joshua and squatted
beside him, but, remembering his loss of a short time before,
refused to bet against another sure-thing nature game.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>And in wonder he watched his brother take up the slug
and place the open razor, edge up, on the ground. Then
Joshua put the slug on the handle of the razor and prodded
it along until it crawled to the keen edge. Here it tried
to go sidewise and reach the ground, but with a small stick
Joshua kept it to the course. And along the keen edge the
slow creature made its way, adding to the thrills of its brief
terrestrial day.</p>

<p>“Gosh, Joshua! Ain’t it cuttin’ ’im?”</p>

<p>“Don’t see any blood, do you?”</p>

<p>“Uh-uh!”</p>

<p>“Ye wouldn’t either, I guess. Ain’t no blood in ’em,
I’m thinkin’. But he ain’t drippin’ <i>anything</i>, is he? He’s
got insides, ain’t he? There’d be somethin’ to drip if he
was gettin’ cut, wouldn’t they?”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh. But ain’t it hurtin’ ’im at all, Josh?”</p>

<p>“Course not, rummy! There he goes off on the ground.
Now watch while I turn ’im over, kid. You won’t see a ole
cut or anything.”</p>

<p>And when Joshua’s gently prodding stick had laid the
long-suffering mollusk on its back its belly showed none the
worse for the experience.</p>

<p>“Josh, how’d he stay on?”</p>

<p>“I can’t tell ye that. But I’ll know some day. Then
come ’round and ast me.”</p>

<p>“And why’n’t it cut ’im?”</p>

<p>“Can’t tell that either—but sometime I will.”</p>

<p>“How ye gonta ever tell, Josh?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. There’s a lotta things I gotta find out,
kid. There’s books an’ things that’ll tell ye all about things
like that. I’m gonta get the names of ’em sometime. Now
what’ll we do till ole Slinky Dawson comes along with
Madmallet’s letter to the folks?”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br>

<small>THE GIRL AT THE CRESCENT</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AN even greater ogre to the Cole boys than Silvanus
Madmallet was their father, John Cole, traveling
salesman for a wholesale hardware firm. Their
mother, who had been Blanche Florence before her marriage,
came of an old and respected family that had come
over with Lord Calvert when Maryland was settled. She
had married Cole against the family’s wish, and had been
paying dearly ever since.</p>

<p>For John Cole was a self-centered brute, a hard master,
a spendthrift. The boys did not know—though the mother
did—that Cole fancied fast horses and fast women. He
was a heavy drinker, but never a sot, for he carried his
liquor well. In fact, but for the gloomy, suppressed rage
in which it kept him almost constantly, few would have
known that he was a steady drinking man.</p>

<p>While he tolerated his son Lester as a necessary nuisance,
it seemed at times that he all but hated his older boy. He
could not understand Joshua, with his constant, fearless,
gray-blue eyes, and the boy’s gravity jarred upon him.
And, as in the case of Madmallet, the fact that he could
not break the lad’s spirit with the brutal punishment that
he inflicted piqued his pride and made him merciless.</p>

<p>He labored under the delusion that Joshua was a “bad
boy.” Silvanus Madmallet had told him so, for one thing.
Joshua did not progress in the studies prescribed for him,
and persisted in reading books which no child should be
allowed to read. John Cole did not understand these books<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
himself; they aroused no interest in his unimaginative mind.
They were heretic, and while John Cole himself was anything
but a firm believer in the Word of God, it was proper
that his sons should be. He had taken from Joshua
Steele’s <i>Chemistry</i>, Darwin’s <i>Origin of Man</i> and his <i>Descent
of Man</i>, and Huxley’s <i>Man’s Place In Nature</i>. He
himself had tried to read these books to find out, if possible,
what it was all about. And it had proved not possible
for him to find out what it was all about. When questioned
closely, after Joshua’s head had been submerged in a
bathtub full of water until he fell gasping on the floor when
released, the boy confessed that he understood but little of
what he was reading, but that it interested him nevertheless.</p>

<p>Thrusting his sons’ heads under water until they were
all but drowned was John Cole’s own diabolical invention as
a form of punishment, and though Lester escaped the terrible
ordeal except for what were considered serious offenses,
it was meted out to Joshua upon the slightest provocation.
For Joshua was “bad,” and it was suspected that
what sinfulness was Lester’s was the result of the influence
exerted over him by his older brother. The boys’ mother
was helpless to prevent these outrages, for he was unshaken
by her tears; and threatening to leave her husband only
brought forth the lofty invitation: “Go any time you feel
like it, Blanche.” And she knew that John Cole meant it.
He cared nothing for her. He had squandered her fortune,
and continued to live with her, perhaps, only in the vague
hope that some wealthy relative of hers might die and leave
her more money, which would be easy loot for him again.
Despite his constant drinking and his shady affairs with
women, Cole was well thought of by his employers. For
he was a different man when dealing with them and when
calling upon the trade, and, above all, he was a marvelous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
“money-getter.” But the mother and her boys thanked
heaven more than once that his business activities necessarily
kept him away from home the greater portion of
the time.</p>

<p>No small wonder, then, that Joshua and Lester, as they
lazed in the vacant lot and awaited the coming of Slinky
Dawson with the note to their parents, planned to stop
that note midway in its journey. Slinky Dawson’s route
home carried him directly past the Cole house, and the boys
had every reason to believe that he would bear the note
that day at noon. Their father was away selling goods, but
that fact offered no consolation. Joshua had been expelled
and Lester suspended for a week, and there was
no possibility of their keeping the dread news from their
father when he returned.</p>

<p>Lester continued his whining as the hours dragged on,
but Joshua lay on his back on the moist earth, to the vast
delight of the Cold-and-Croup Demon, and looked up at
the blue spring sky. Joshua was forever looking up at the
sky when not engaged in disturbing the daily routine of
slugs or tumblebugs or spiders.</p>

<p>“Josh, what <i>are</i> we gonta do?” came the oft-repeated
wail from Lester.</p>

<p>“Goin’ West,” said Joshua, linking his fingers behind
his head and continuing his gazing into the heavens.</p>

<p>“Aw, ye’re jest talkin’!” accused the younger brother.
“How c’n ye go West? Where’s yer money to go with?
Ye’re always sayin’ ye’re goin’ West, but I notice ye’ve
never done it.”</p>

<p>“A fella could go on the tramp,” said Joshua. “Folks’ll
give a fella somethin’ to eat when they see he’s hungry an’
honest. I’ve talked to tramps—kids no older’n me. They
have a swell time, Les. Then maybe I c’n get some money
down at the ole skatin’ rink. You leave it to me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>“What’ll we do when we get West, Josh?”</p>

<p>“Well—now—they’s lots o’ things a fella c’n do,” answered
Joshua. “There’s kids no older’n us that are cowboys.
I’ve read lots an’ lots o’ stories about ’em.”</p>

<p>Which proved that young Joshua, though consecrated to
science, had not altogether put away boyish things.</p>

<p>“We’ll go down to the rink to-night and see what’s
doin’,” he continued. “I c’n pick up a dime or a quarter,
maybe, and we c’n get somethin’ to eat before we start.
Then when we get away from the city, eatin’ll be easy.”</p>

<p>“Josh, you know you won’t go. You been talkin’ about
it for years and years.”</p>

<p>“I will too go!” protested Joshua. “You just watch
and see, boy! I’m goin’ this time. No more drownin’ for
me—I got enough o’ that ole duckin’ business, myself.”</p>

<p>To tell the truth, though Joshua now told himself that
he would take this long-threatened step, he was worried
in his heart of hearts. But, boylike, he bolstered up his
courage and dreamed of the adventure, while all the time
something at the back of his mind laughed at him and told
him that he was talking folly. One thing certain, though,
he would not go home and face his father, that father knowing
that he had been expelled from school. He felt that
he could not stand one more submersion in that terrible
water, with his pulse throbbing at his temples and the
horrible pangs of strangulation clutching at his throat and
contracting his heart, and everything growing black. No,
no more of that! He might not go West, but he never would
return home with that awaiting him.</p>

<p>The hours dragged on, and when the warm sun was high
in the heavens the entrance of the brick schoolhouse vomited
a stream of yelling, shoving, elbowing young humanity
that at once disintegrated and spread in all directions.
Then it was that Joshua and Lester left their places and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
hid behind a high-board fence close by. Here they watched
friends and acquaintances pass hurriedly till at length
came Slinky Dawson, walking with importance.</p>

<p>His importance soon forsook him, for presently upon him
pounced two young highwaymen demanding the cause of
his importance. Joshua stood in his path, fists on hips, and
Lester threatened him on his right.</p>

<p>“What ye got, Dawson?” demanded Joshua.</p>

<p>Slinky Dawson’s freckled face grew paler than it was
ordinarily, for Slinky was an unhealthy, boot-licking, soft-spoken
bigot, one of those beings doomed for life to be the
scorn of less gentle but more red-blooded males.</p>

<p>“I haven’t anything, Joshua,” he replied, a look of fear
and guilt in his milk-blue eyes. Slinky Dawson never would
have said, “I ain’t got anything,” and he invariably called
his schoolmates by their first names. Which proved that he
was no man.</p>

<p>“You’re a liar,” Joshua told him smoothly. “Dare ye
to take it up!”</p>

<p>Slinky squirmed and his thin lips fluttered. Slinky never
took up anything.</p>

<p>“Aw, gi’me that note to our folks, kid,” said Joshua,
stepping closer, disgust written on his face. “Don’t
monkey with me, boy, er I’ll bust ye wide open! You know
me. Gi’me Ole Madmallet’s letter before I smash yeh!”</p>

<p>“I—I— Honest, Joshua—”</p>

<p>Joshua drew back a threatening fist, then slowly brought
it forward until it was rubbing Slinky’s nose. “Gonta
gi’me it, boy?”</p>

<p>“Ye-yes, sir!” And Slinky reached trembling fingers
into his blouse and produced an unsealed envelope. “Honest,
Joshua, I couldn’t help it. Mr. Madmallet—”</p>

<p>“Dry up!”</p>

<p>Joshua had snatched the envelope from Slinky’s hand,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
and as he read aloud the superscription on the back his
sarcastic tones were an attempt to imitate Madmallet’s:</p>

<p>“‘Mrs. John H. Cole, Three fifty-five Grant Avenue.
Kindness of Albert Dawson.’</p>

<p>“Well, you ain’t gonta be so kind, after all, Mr. Albert
Dawson,” jeered the leader of the outlaws. “And now
lissen to me, kid: If you don’t go back this afternoon an’
tell Ole Sorehatchet that you give this note to our mother,
me’n’ Les’ll lay fer you an’ knock the stuffin’ outa you.
Don’t you ferget it, kid! Now go on home an’ keep yer
face closed.”</p>

<p>“But—”</p>

<p>“Gwan, I’m tellin’ ye!”</p>

<p>And Slinky Dawson, glad that the ordeal was over but
with a sinking heart for the consequences of his remissness,
faded away.</p>

<p>Joshua read the contents of the envelope, a brief statement
of what had occurred, then tore the paper to shreds.</p>

<p>“Now, c’m’on, kid,” said he. “Le’s get down to the
Crescent an’ see what’s doin’.”</p>

<p>Most boys who possess such a studious turn of mind as
did Joshua are of the Slinky Dawson type. Slinky was inefficient
in everything except his studies. He could not play
ball; any boy in school could outrun him; any boy could
whip him. Joshua, on the other hand, was one of the
foremost athletes in Hathaway’s Boyland. But, then, it
was not dreamed that Joshua was a student. Had he not
failed repeatedly in arithmetic and grammar? Then how
could he be a studious boy? That he was the best pitcher
on the Third-room Nine was an established fact. That
he could run and jump and wrestle went undisputed. And
that no one in the city—man, woman, girl or boy—could
equal him on roller-skates was supposed to be the height of
his accomplishments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>For more than a year he had visited the Crescent Skating
Rink in the heart of the city whenever opportunity
offered. There during the past winter he had come in
contact with an operatic star, who, seeing his grace and
expertness, and herself being an enthusiastic novice at the
sport, had asked him to teach her. It seemed that roller-skating
had become a fad with a certain opera company
that was playing in Hathaway, and the boy’s marvelous
performances had aroused the interest of all of them,
after the first lady of the troupe had smiled upon him.
One thing led to another, and, though the troupe had long
since left the city, Joshua’s services were still in demand
by novices who wished to learn to skate. Being only a boy,
and in school a greater part of the time at that, the owners
of the rink had not offered him a position as instructor.
But they encouraged him and allowed him to take tips from
those who asked for his help.</p>

<p>To the Crescent Rink the boys now betook themselves,
and the ticket-taker passed them in free, for Lester had
often accompanied his brother. Lester sat in the spectators’
gallery brooding over his trouble, while Joshua put on a
pair of skates and glided out on the floor, the envy of the
awkward skaters already assembled. Before long Joshua
had a pupil, and after half an hour he had a tip of twenty-five
cents. Then his charge left the rink, and he sought
new fields.</p>

<p>He glided gracefully about the floor, on the alert for
some one who wished to be taught, and as he made the
second round his eyes alighted upon a girl with reddish-golden
hair, who, unaided by an escort, was putting on
her skates. Joshua executed a long curve and swept up
beside her.</p>

<p>“Le’me help you,” he offered, and bent on one knee
before her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>He heard a girlish giggle of bashfulness and looked up
into reddish-brown eyes that matched the hair.</p>

<p>And then, for love strikes quick and sure to the heart of
a red-blooded boy, Joshua Cole knew that his eyes beheld
the most glorious creature in all the world, and something
came up in his throat and nearly choked him. It was as
sudden and unexpected as a blow between the eyes.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br>

<small>THE GYPO QUEEN</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">JOSHUA’S fingers fumbled with the straps of the
roller-skates, and his ears felt hot. Girls had meant
little to him. There had been a couple or more mild
affairs, but the flame had died down within a day or two.
This was different. In the winking of an eyelash Joshua
Cole was head over heels in love. And how it hurt!</p>

<p>At last there remained no further excuse for him to
keep on bended knee before her. The skates were adjusted;
he must needs stand up and face those deadly eyes
again. Like unto an Oriental topaz was their color, and
her hair was bronze and hung down her back in a long,
thick rope. He struggled to his feet at last, and, miserable
beyond measure, lifted his eyes. He found that the long,
reddish lashes were hiding hers and that the pink of May
blossoms was in her cheeks. They were brown, too, those
cheeks, and the pink blended with the brown to form a
color combination utterly bewildering. He thought that
the skin of Pocahontas must have looked like that—just
why he could not have said.</p>

<p>“Ye’re all fixed now, I guess,” he mumbled in crackling
tones. “C’n you skate?”</p>

<p>“A little,” she replied, without lifting her glance to his.
“I’m just learning.”</p>

<p>And now Joshua Cole did the boldest thing in his life
when he asked:</p>

<p>“Du-d’ye want me to teach you?”</p>

<p>A moment’s hesitation, then, with a laugh: “Uh-huh—I
don’t care.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>Awkwardly he helped her up on her skates and took her
hands. And then they glided out onto the floor. Round
and round he guided her, searching desperately for words.
Their silence was long and embarrassing, but at last the
girl broke it.</p>

<p>“You can skate fine, can’t you? I wish I could, but I’ve
not been trying long.”</p>

<p>“I’m pretty good at it, I guess,” he said not proudly.
“I never saw you here before. I come lots. Almost every
afternoon when school’s out.”</p>

<p>“I’ve not been here often,” she helped on the conversation.
“And I don’t go to school.”</p>

<p>“Don’t they make you?”</p>

<p>“No. My mother teaches me. We’re here and there. I
live in a camp down by the railroad tracks.”</p>

<p>“A camp? What kind of a camp?”</p>

<p>“I guess you wouldn’t know if I was to tell you,” she
laughed. She laughed almost every time she spoke, thought
Joshua; and, while it was a merry little trill, it bore as
well a note of nervousness. She seemed to find conversation
as much of an effort as Joshua was finding it.</p>

<p>“Tell me anyway,” he begged.</p>

<p>“It’s a gypo camp.”</p>

<p>“That’s a funny word. What’s gypo mean?”</p>

<p>“Oh, it would take too long to tell.”</p>

<p>“No ’twouldn’t. Go on! Won’tcha?”</p>

<p>“Well, a gypo camp is— Oh, I can’t tell you here!
There’s so much to tell.”</p>

<p>“Le’s quit skatin’ and set down a while.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care.”</p>

<p>He guided her to a bench, and they sat down three feet
apart.</p>

<p>“Go on tell me, now,” he pleaded.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s railroad work—building railroads, you know.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
A gypo man’s a little contractor—you know what I mean—not
a little <i>man</i>, but a little contractor that don’t amount
to much. He’s got a little outfit and he takes sub-contracts
from the big fellows. My father’s a gypo man, and they
call the camp of a man like him a gypo camp. I’m a gypo
queen.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“Well,” she amplified, “a gypo queen is a gypo man’s
daughter. That’s easy. Sometimes they call a gypo man
a shanty man, and then his camp is a shanty camp and
his daughter is a shanty queen. It’s all the same. It’s
hobo lingo.”</p>

<p>“What d’ye do down there?”</p>

<p>“Well, I work some—a little. And my mother teaches
me. She’s well educated. You see, there isn’t much chance
for me to go to regular school, as we hardly ever stay in
one place longer than three months. Then sometimes my
mother lets me come up here to skate. Sometimes I drive
horses on a slip, too. Do you know what that is?”</p>

<p>Joshua shook his head.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s just a dirt scraper. When you load it they
call it sticking pigs. It’s lots of fun. And sometimes it’ll
flip up and jerk out o’ your hands, and you lose your load
and all. I can drive pretty well. We’re almost through
on the job we’re on now, and then Pa says we’re going
West. We’ve been on the double-track job, you know—working
just out o’ town.”</p>

<p>“I’m on my way West, too,” Joshua informed her importantly.</p>

<p>“Don’t you go to school?”</p>

<p>“Did till to-day. Then they fired me.”</p>

<p>“Expelled you! What for?”</p>

<p>Joshua began the story of Madmallet’s tyranny and his
own disgrace, and the Oriental-topaz eyes glowed warmly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
as she listened to every word. It was thrilling to have her
watching him so, and Joshua may be excused if he made
himself appear something of a bold, bad outlaw.</p>

<p>“Would you ’a’ smashed him?” she wanted to know.</p>

<p>“You bet yer neck I would,” said Joshua. “Can’t
come nothin’ like that on me. I wonder if I—if I—now— Could
I get a job, d’ye s’pose, and go West with your
father’s gypo thing? Me and Les?”</p>

<p>“Is Les your brother’s name?”</p>

<p>“Lester. Us kids call ’im Les. My name’s Joshua. I
don’t like that name, do you? Nobody wants an ole
Bible name like that, do they?”</p>

<p>“Uh-uh—I don’t mind it,” she told him.</p>

<p>Then a silence fell between them. It grew more tense
as time went on, with the eyes of both abased. Then said
she of the bronze-gold hair:</p>

<p>“You haven’t asked me my name, have you?”</p>

<p>Helpful little flirt! Long before Joshua would have
asked it had he dared.</p>

<p>“I will now,” he said. “What is it?”</p>

<p>“It’s Madge.”</p>

<p>“Madge what?”</p>

<p>“You didn’t tell me <i>your</i> last name. You tell first.”</p>

<p>“Cole, then.”</p>

<p>“And mine’s Mundy. And you’ll think my father has
a funny nickname. The hobos call a nickname a monaker.
Pa’s is Bloodmop.”</p>

<p>“That’s a corker!” Joshua enthused. “Why they call
’im that?”</p>

<p>“Well, he’s got a very heavy head of fiery-red hair.
The stiffs say it looks like a mop that’s been used to clean
up blood after a murder. They’re awfully funny, some
of them. My hair’s a little red, too. Ma’s is black, and
they say that’s how comes mine to be like it is, with Pa’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
so red and Ma’s so black. Your hair’s black, isn’t it?
And your eyes are almost blue. That’s kinda funny, don’t
you think?”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh—it’s awfully funny,” Joshua agreed.
“Where’d you learn so many funny words?”</p>

<p>“In camp.”</p>

<p>“But you didn’t say whether your father’d take me and
Les out West with ’im.”</p>

<p>“What could you do?”</p>

<p>“We could do anything,” he told her with assurance.
“We’d oughta be able to drive a team if you can.”</p>

<p>“But I just do it for fun. And you’d have to do it all
day long. I guess you’re both too young”—she looked at
him speculatively—“to work all day on a job like that.
But one of you might be water boy. That’s about all there
is for a kid to do in a construction camp that’s workin’
in dirt. If we were rockmen, you might get a job as powder
monkey, and carry powder to the dynos and drills to the
blacksmith shop to be sharpened. You didn’t say how old
you are.”</p>

<p>“I’m pretty near fifteen,” said Joshua. (He lacked
nine months of being fifteen.) “How old are you?”</p>

<p>“Eleven, but I’m large for my age. How old’s your
brother?”</p>

<p>“Who, Les? Why, le’s see. I guess he’s about thirteen.
I ferget. Say, I’ll go get him. And don’t you think
there’d be a chance for us?”</p>

<p>“I could speak to Pa about it. It’s lots o’ fun—traveling
with a construction outfit. You take all the stock with
you, you know—the horses and mules. I mean you ride on
the same train with them. We always go in a converted
boxcar, and—”</p>

<p>“What’s that? Where’d the boxcar get converted—at a
revival meetin’?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>“Aw, you’re just trying to be funny! A converted boxcar
is one made over so that people can live in it. There’s
a place for a stove, and bunks with curtains along each
side. And next to it a flatcar is hooked on, and that’s
your wood-yard—or if you burn coal, it’s your coal-yard.
Just like a back yard at home, you know. And while the
freight train is traveling you go over the tops of the cars
and feed and water the mules and horses every day. It’s
just like a farm on wheels. I’ve walked over the top of a
freight train lots of times—when it was going pretty fast,
too. And once when we moved from Ohio to a new job
in Louisiana we had chickens on the flatcar, and a cow that
gave milk in one of the boxcars. Pa milked her every day—morning
and night. Don’t you think you’d like to travel
that way?”</p>

<p>“I <i>guess</i> I <i>would</i>! Will yeh ask yer father about what
I told you—Les an’ me goin’ along? We’ll work like the
dickens—honest!”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh—sure I will. I don’t mind.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll go get Les and tell ’im”—and Joshua stooped
to remove his skates.</p>

<p>But a search of the spectators’ seats revealed no Lester
humped up with his misery.</p>

<p>Joshua grew apprehensive. Had his brother taken this
opportunity to sneak home and face punishment? In his
heart he felt that this was what had happened. He hurried
back to Madge.</p>

<p>“He—he’s gone,” he announced, in sepulchral tones.
“And I—I guess I’ll have to be goin’, too. I gotta see
what he’s done. I’m afraid he’s got scared out and gone
home and spoiled it all. When’ll I see ye again,
Ma-Madge?”</p>

<p>“Why, I’ll be here to-morrow, I guess.”</p>

<p>“About this time?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>“I guess so—uh-huh.”</p>

<p>“Well, then I’ll see you again. And ask yer father what
I told you to—you know—about goin’ West.”</p>

<p>“All right; I’ll ask him.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, gu-good-by.”</p>

<p>“Good-by,” she said demurely.</p>

<p>Joshua slowed his steps when he entered that part of
Hathaway’s residential district in which the Cole home was
situated. It was not yet four o’clock in the afternoon, and
the spring sun was shining brightly overhead. Everything
was quiet, and the stillness awed him a little, for now, more
than ever, he realized the grave step that he had taken. But
his spirits refused moroseness; it was such a day in spring
as calls insistently to adventurers—a day for boys to dream
of pirates and desert islands, and caravans forging slowly
toward vague frontiers. So Joshua put behind him all
thoughts of his predicament and let his mind dwell on
Madge Mundy and a freight train traveling West, with a
certain car that had for an auxiliary a flatcar with all the
familiar appurtenances of one’s own back yard.</p>

<p>At the corner of his block he came to a halt. He did
not wish to be seen by any of the neighbors. He stood
there, irresolute, watching the front of his home, which
was about all that he could see. If only he dared sneak
around to the kitchen door and confide in Zida. But this
comprised too great a risk.</p>

<p>For perhaps half an hour he loitered about the corner,
hoping for sight of his deserting brother. He wanted to
make sure that Lester had been unfaithful before wiping
him forever out of his glowing plans for the future. But
he saw nothing of Lester, and was without a scheme for
finding out what he wished to know, when the pupils homeward
hound from school came trooping toward him.</p>

<p>Across the street a cellar door stood open invitingly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
Joshua hurried over, and, as no one was about, quickly hid
himself in the dark passageway. He kept his head below
the level of the street until he heard the familiar voices of
his gang—the squeaky tones of “Did” Eustace, the boastful
voice of “Spud” Mulligan, and others well known to
him.</p>

<p>Then he raised his head and looked across the street,
to see five of his particular friends loitering along, shoving
one another off the sidewalk, pushing one against another,
or jerking neckties until the knots became so tight that
fingers could scarce undo them.</p>

<p>“Spud! Oh, Spud!” he called cannily; and as the
group turned, he left the cellarway and ran across the
street.</p>

<p>“Oh, lookut who got fired!” began the volley of greetings.
“Gysh, kid! Whatcha been doin’? Whatja dad
haveta say? I’ll betcha ye got yours, all right, all right!
Say, boy, you sure stood up to Ole Hothatchet! Gysh!”</p>

<p>“Listen, Spud!” said Joshua, grasping his friend’s shirt
and interrupting the general clatter of admiration. “Do
somethin’ f’r me?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” said Spud readily. “Whatcha want, Cole?”</p>

<p>“Les, he backed out, I think—he quit me down at the
rink. We was goin’ West—had everythin’ fixed. And then
he turned me down. That’s what I think, anyway. But I
wanta know f’r sure. You go to the house an’ ring the
bell and ast if he’s there. Just pretend like you don’t
know nothin’—see? Don’t let on or anythin’. Just say:
‘Mrs. Cole, I’d like to see Les a minute, if he’s home.’
And if he’s there she’ll tell ye. Go on—do that f’r me,
Spud! Won’tcha? Aw, gwan an’ do it. I’ll do somethin’
f’r you sometime.”</p>

<p>Spud hesitated a little, assailed by a boy’s natural dislike
for approaching the parent of one of his friends on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
a delicate matter. But in the end he gave in; and the rest
went around the corner and peeked out while he importantly
retraced his steps down the street and crossed to the
Cole house.</p>

<p>The watchers saw him reach out his hand to press the
bell button beside the front door. They saw him standing
there in a waiting attitude, and knew by his uneasiness as
displayed by leg movements the moment that the door was
opened. They were unable to see Mrs. Cole, and did not
know whether she or Zida had answered the bell until Spud
scraped off his disreputable cap and came clattering down
the stairs. He ran up the street and rounded the corner,
where the eager gang awaited him.</p>

<p>“He’s home, all right, all right,” he announced. “All’t
yer mother’d say was: ‘Yes, he’s home, but he can’t come
out.’ You fellas know what that means. He’s locked up.
Say, he’ll get his!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br>

<small>THE GYPO CAMP</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">HALF an hour after learning that Lester preferred a
ducking to life in the boundless West, Joshua,
a David bereft of his Jonathan, entered the Crescent
Rink and put on his skates again. He had earned
twenty-five cents that afternoon, and there was the possibility
of earning more when the evening crowd came in.
He looked all about for Madge Mundy, but caught no sight
of her. His heart was bitter against Lester, but finally he
decided that, after all, his brother had acted wisely. It was
barely possible that, when news reached home of his own
expulsion, the upheaval would be so great that Lester’s
minor infraction would be forgotten. Anyway, Lester was
not old enough to go West with him—he lacked nerve. But
Joshua missed his companionship, and, now all alone on his
great adventure, felt lonely and downcast beyond all words.</p>

<p>He was unfortunate that evening, for no one asked for
his services as skating instructor. And about eight o’clock,
as he was beginning to be ravenously hungry by reason of
having missed his lunch, he left the rink and sought a
restaurant.</p>

<p>Sandwiches at five cents each and a hungry boy of fourteen
with a lone twenty-five-cent piece in his sweaty palm
do not make a very satisfactory combination. One sandwich
after another he felt obliged to eat, until four had
been consumed. Then, still hungry but painfully aware
that only five cents remained of his precious quarter, he
paid up and went out into the lighted street.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>Back at the rink he skated for an hour with no more luck
than earlier in the evening. Only then did the problem of
quarters for the night present itself to him as a grim
reality. So he skated on until closing time, and then went
out no richer than he had entered.</p>

<p>Well, he had become an outlaw, and outlaws must make
the best of things. He sauntered along the street, marveling
that a March night could be so cold at twelve o’clock.
The crowds had long since thinned, and only here and there
he encountered a lone pedestrian hurrying—somewhere.
He avoided three policemen, and took to a side street,
wandering toward the railroad yards.</p>

<p>He wondered if he could find Madge’s camp. Surely, in
a camp, there would be some place for him to sleep. This
was a trifle different than he had planned—different from
his imaginings over there in the sunny, swampy lot where
he and his brother had awaited the coming of Slinky
Dawson.</p>

<p>He found the freight yards eventually, avoided the depot
and other railroad buildings, and made his way to the
farther end of the property. He crossed a system of tracks,
and then the open door of an empty boxcar invited him
to enter and make himself at home. He crawled inside,
closed the creaky door, and lay down in a corner on the
floor. It was warmer here, and he made a pillow of his arm.
He began to revise his plans, but in the midst of this he
fell asleep.</p>

<p>Several times that night he awoke with the cold, but
was so worn out and sleepy that he at once dozed off
again. A severe shock brought him fully awake at last,
and he felt the car moving gently. He ran to the door and
slid it open. Sitting down with his feet dangling, he
jumped unexpertly to the ground, and was at once confronted
by a grimy switchman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>“Well, kid, where’d you come from?” he asked in a not
unkindly tone.</p>

<p>“From in there,” was Joshua’s unnecessary answer to an
equally unnecessary question.</p>

<p>“On the bum?”</p>

<p>“Yeah.”</p>

<p>“Huh! You don’t look it. Ain’t been on it long, have
you?”</p>

<p>Joshua grinned, not daring to make reply.</p>

<p>“Well, you better keep your eye peeled for the railroad
cop,” said the switchman, as he marched on about his own
affairs beside the slowly moving train, to which Joshua’s
car had been coupled on.</p>

<p>“Say, Mister!” Joshua called after him.</p>

<p>“Well, get it outa ye!”</p>

<p>“I want to know if there’s a railroad camp about here
somewhere—where they’re double-trackin’ the road?”</p>

<p>“Lookin’ for a job?”</p>

<p>“Yeah—sure.”</p>

<p>“Husky stiff you’ll make! Right down the tracks, son.
You can’t miss it.”</p>

<p>It was very early in the morning; the sun had not yet
risen. The air was cool and the strips of steel that would
sprawl eventually to all corners of the continent were wet
with dew. Birds were singing in the treetops. The blood
of the earth throbbed with the tonic of spring.</p>

<p>Joshua trudged along, whistling. His doubts had vanished
with the birth of a new day, and he thrilled at
thought of his grand adventure. He came to a pool of
rain water in which he washed his hands and face, allowing
the soft morning breeze to dry them. Then he walked
on and on, and at times he felt like running from the sheer
joy of living, but was reminded that he was now a man
and must carry himself sedately.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>He came to where the buildings were few and far between,
and smaller and more disreputable and smoke-stained
they became as he forged on. And now far ahead,
in a flat open space, he saw the near-white tents of a camp.</p>

<p>This quickened his steps despite his new religion of
decorum, and before long he was approaching his destination,
and saw men washing in tin basins that were set on a
bench beside one of the larger tents. From a listing chimney
that topped this tent blue smoke arose and was whipped
away on the breeze. And as the adventurer drew closer the
odors of cooking that floated to his nostrils reminded him
that he was hungry.</p>

<p>There were several tents. One of them—a large one—had
no walls, and under the canopy top Joshua saw horses
and mules eating hay and grain and switching their tails
in anticipation of the onslaught of flies which would begin
when the morning was a little older. The clanking of the
metal parts of their harness Joshua somehow liked to hear.
It suggested all that he hoped might lie before him in the
West.</p>

<p>The men were now going into the dining tent, one by
one, or in pairs. All were within before the boy entered
the camp. He saw nobody now, but from the tent came
rough voices and an occasional burst of coarse laughter,
mingling with the metallic sounds of knives and forks.</p>

<p>Though the exterior of the camp was deserted, Joshua
was seized by a sudden backwardness. For worlds he would
not have gone to the door of that dining tent, and he feared
to move about lest some one challenge him. So he walked
away to a respectful distance and sat down on the ground,
watching the horses and mules in the stable tent and speculating
over the uses of the various implements that he
saw about.</p>

<p>For some little time he sat there, then the men began to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
come from the tent singly and in small groups. Two or
three of them glanced his way, and this made him rise and
move farther off. He decided that he was foolish to have
come. He dreaded ridicule, and these tramplike workmen
looked capable of any form of rude word-torture. He would
go back to the city and wait until Madge came to the skating
rink that afternoon.</p>

<p>And then as he cast a last look toward the camp he saw
her coming from a small tent in the rear of the dining
tent. Next instant he heard her calling.</p>

<p>She came to meet him as he turned and made slow steps
in her direction. The men had for the most part gone to
the stable tent, and before the girl reached Joshua somebody
began pounding a ringing tattoo on a large triangle.
Then all of the men trooped to the tent, and were leading
forth the teams as Madge began surprised remarks over
his coming.</p>

<p>“Why, what on earth brought you here this time o’ day?
How’d you find us? Did you stay away from home all
night?”</p>

<p>Joshua grinned in confusion, but he felt better immediately.
This girl was like no other girl that he had met.
While she seemed modest enough and not lacking in that
intangible feminine instinct to make no open approaches
toward the male of the species, she was free and easy-spoken
and friendly to a high degree.</p>

<p>“I just thought I’d—now—sneak down this way,” he
told her. “A switchman told me the way. Ole Les quit
me, all right. He’s gone home. I had to sleep in a boxcar
last night.”</p>

<p>“Did you really?” she laughed. “That’s nothing for a
stiff. They’re all tramps—all these railroaders. You’d get
used to things like that if you went on the railroad grade.
But ain’t you really ever going home again?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>He shook his head. “No more o’ that duckin’ in mine,”
he said.</p>

<p>“I think that’s a perfectly awful way for a father to
treat his boy,” she sympathized. “I told Pa and Ma
about you last night.”</p>

<p>“Didja?”—eagerly. “What’d they say?”</p>

<p>“Well, Pa didn’t just know. He said he didn’t like to
interfere in anything like that—you know, come between
a boy and his father. But he said putting your head under
water that way was mighty mean, and he’d bet a dollar
he could whip the man that he saw doing it. You see, Pa
isn’t like most folks. He’s lived out in camps so much
that he—well, I don’t just know how to say it—but he’s—well,
I guess you’d call it liberal. But he said you oughta
go home, and maybe they’d forgive you.”</p>

<p>“He don’t know my father,” said Joshua, shaking his
head. “No, I won’t go home, Madge, no matter what
happens.”</p>

<p>“I don’t blame you, I guess. But say—I’ll bet you
haven’t had a bite of breakfast! Of course you haven’t!
Well, neither have I. Don’t you want to come and eat with
us? Ma’ll be glad to have you.”</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t be any bother, would it?”</p>

<p>“Of course not, silly! Come on. Ma and I always eat
after the stiffs’ve gone out to work. Pa eats with them.
We’ve got a dandy cook. Come on—Joshua.”</p>

<p>The morning sun accentuated the Pocahontas coloring in
her cheeks. She wore a red-checked gingham dress. Her
bronze hair hung loose down her back, and was gathered
with a ribbon at the nape of her neck. Joshua noticed now
that it was “frizzly” instead of straight or wavy or curly,
and he thought that if he were to squeeze it in his hand it
would immediately spring free again, like the stuffing of a
curled-hair mattress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>At the door of the dining tent Madge introduced him
to her mother:</p>

<p>“Ma, this is the boy I was telling you about. He slept
in a boxcar all night. And—and he hasn’t had any breakfast.
So I invited him.”</p>

<p>Madge’s mother proved to be a comely woman of over
forty, and Joshua was not a little surprised at her apparent
refinement. While a boy of fourteen makes few
pretenses of being himself refined, he is quick to note it or
the lack of it in his elders. She was dressed simply and
neatly in an inexpensive house gown. Joshua wondered,
too, how she could look so fresh and unsoiled in a camp by
the railroad tracks, where men worked all day long at
moving dirt.</p>

<p>She held out her hand and smiled. “We’d like to have
you stay to breakfast with us,” she said. “Madge has told
me quite a bit about you. I’d like to hear more. And it
may be that I can help you.”</p>

<p>“No’m,” said Joshua. “I guess nobody can help me. I
guess I only wanta go West. I can’t go home again—I
guess that’s the way you want to help me.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Mundy only smiled and led the way into the dining
tent.</p>

<p>The three sat at one end of a long oilcloth-covered table,
and the camp cook, a dark man with a heavy mustache, in
a dingy white apron and white cook’s coat and cap, waited
on them, setting a wide assortment of food before them in
deep granite pans.</p>

<p>“Tell me about yourself,” suggested Madge’s mother
when the cook had left them to themselves.</p>

<p>Joshua told his story again, and Mrs. Mundy listened
attentively to every word.</p>

<p>“It’s rather a strange case,” was her only comment as
he finished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>Presently a man with heavy, fiery-red hair entered the
tent. Immediately Joshua knew him for “Bloodmop”
Mundy, the father of Madge, and he knew that he would
like this man with the twinkling sky-blue eyes, at the
corners of which queer little crow’s-feet came and went,
giving his face that quizzical, whimsical look which boys
interpret as belonging to a man who is friendly and sympathetic
to them and interested in their boyish activities.
Bloodmop Mundy wore dirty yellow overalls and a disreputable
slouch hat, and needed a shave. The sleeves of
his blue chambray shirt were rolled up to his elbows, displaying
great, muscle-corded arms on which the red hairs
looked redder still by reason of the deep tan which was their
background.</p>

<p>“Well, who in the dickens is this?” was his method of
recognizing Joshua’s unfamiliar presence, and his voice
came in a deep, musical boom.</p>

<p>Joshua stood up from the table while Mrs. Mundy broke
the news.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m a son-of-a-gun!”—and the crow’s-feet
shuttled at the corners of his twinkling blue eyes.
“And was you really gonta soak th’ ole devil with th’
poker, kid?”</p>

<p>“George,” cautioned his wife, “watch your tongue.”</p>

<p>“Yes’m—excuse me, ’Lizabeth. Set down, kid—set down
an’ finish yer chow. What ye gonta do about it when all’s
said an’ done?”</p>

<p>This, Joshua felt, was his great opportunity. “I—I
was thinkin’ maybe you could gi’me a job, Mr. Mundy.
Madge, she said maybe you’d see about it. Anyway, she
said she’d ask. Will you? I’m pretty stout. And I’d
work. I wanta go West.”</p>

<p>“Wanta go West, huh! Grow up with th’ country—’sthat
it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>The sky-blue eyes twinkled, and one of them bestowed a
prodigious wink on Mrs. Mundy. “Well, now, what could
ye do? Think ye could skin Jack an’ Ned on roller-skates?”—and
Bloodmop laughed loudly at his own joke.</p>

<p>“He means drive a team of mules,” Madge explained.
“On the railroad grade a span of mules are always called
Jack and Ned.” Then to her father: “Don’t try to tease
him, Pa. He’s had enough trouble, I’d think.”</p>

<p>“Well, he’s lookin’ f’r more,” laughed Bloodmop Mundy.
“It’s a sure thing there’s plenty o’ trouble on the railroad
grade. Well, kid, you stick around to-day and I’ll think it
over. Yes, sir, I’ll just do that. Ma, I bet ye don’t know
what I drifted in here for.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t the remotest idea,” asserted Mrs. Mundy, in
a tone and with a smile that proved her speech a mild
prevarication.</p>

<p>Bloodmop Mundy stepped to her side. “I was goin’ to
drive the buckboard up town to see about some more hay,”
he said. “And I thought I might be killed er somethin’
’fore I got back.”</p>

<p>“In that case—” And here she lifted her face.</p>

<p>He bent over her, and never had Joshua seen a man’s
face so tender as he kissed her softly on the lips. Joshua
had seen his father peck at his mother’s lips when he would
be leaving for a trip, and the coldness of it had made him
consider the kiss of man and wife a sort of ceremony that
must be endured. He realized that men loved women and
women men, but it had never occurred to him that fathers
and mothers loved each other.</p>

<p>“Thank ye, ma’am,” said Bloodmop Mundy. “And now
I’ll throw the leather on the ponies an’ be gettin’ on.
Anythin’ you want? Cook need anythin’?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, I think,” said his wife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>“Well, keep an eye on these here Westerners. I guess
they’ll need watchin’, when all’s said an’ done.”</p>

<p>And with great, mannish strides he left the tent.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mundy asked many questions about Joshua’s father
and mother and his home life, and continued to ask long
after they had finished eating. Joshua told her of a day
when there had been ten negro servants in the house. The
family had lived on Park Avenue then, which was in the
heart of the most exclusive residential section of Hathaway.
He told what little he knew of his mother’s aristocratic
family, and of how he had heard servants’ gossip about
their having ostracized her after her marriage to one of the
insignificant Coles. But mostly he dwelt upon his father’s
seeming delight in holding him with his head submerged in
water in the bathtub until he fell on the floor, sometimes
unconscious.</p>

<p>What effect his disclosures had on Madge’s mother he
had no means of knowing, for she appeared to be a woman
of few words, and now she made no comments. But her
dark eyes were thoughtful as she rose from the table, and
the boy knew that he had made a deep impression, although
he was unable to interpret her mood.</p>

<p>She had risen at the sound of wheels before the door of
the dining tent. Bloodmop had been delayed, it seemed,
and was only then starting on his trip to Hathaway. His
wife hurried out to him, leaving Madge and Joshua at the
table, and the two heard them engaged in low-voiced
conversation.</p>

<p>“They’re talking about you, I think,” Madge whispered.
“Listen!”</p>

<p>But they were unable to distinguish words.</p>

<p>Then the conversation ceased, and they heard the buckboard
drive away.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mundy reëntered the tent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>“Well, Joshua,” she said, “can you find something to
do for a couple of hours?”</p>

<p>“Yes’m—I guess so.”</p>

<p>“Madge must get at her lessons right away, and—”</p>

<p>“Oh, Ma! Couldn’t I put ’em off just for to-day?”
interposed her daughter.</p>

<p>“I think not,” said her mother. “Joshua can find something
to interest him about camp, I suspect. In two hours
you’ll be through.”</p>

<p>This seemed final, for Madge raised no further protest.
Nor did she pout or look downcast. It seemed to Joshua
that Elizabeth Mundy possessed some gentle, secret control
over the rough-necked Bloodmop and their pretty daughter
which would always get her what she wished.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br>

<small>THE WRECK OF THE GOOD SHIP “ARGO”</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">SHORTLY before Madge’s two hours of study were
over Bloodmop Mundy returned to camp in the buckboard.
Joshua was out on the grade watching the
tramp laborers as they handled the teams. Mrs. Mundy
left her tent and followed the vehicle to the stable tent,
where she entered into conversation with her husband as
he unhitched the small bay ponies.</p>

<p>“Well, George, what did you find out about him?” she
asked.</p>

<p>“They didn’t know much about ’im at the skatin’ rink,”
he replied. “But they told me where I might get onto
somethin’, and I follied it up. I saw the fella they sent
me to, who don’t figger at all. But he sent me to a nigger
that used to work for the Coles, and he told me a lot.</p>

<p>“I guess the boy’s tellin’ the truth. This nigger—Ole
Ambrose they call ’im—used to be stable man f’r the Coles.
Say, there was a time when they had a pile o’ money,
’Lizabeth. They lived on Park Avenue an’—”</p>

<p>“Yes, the boy has told me all that,” she interrupted.
“What about the father?”</p>

<p>“No good—absolutely no good, ’Lizabeth. Always
chasin’ ’round with fast women and playin’ the ponies.
He went through his wife’s fortune in a few years, and
now they got only his salary. It’s a good one, I guess, f’r
he’s still playin’ the races an’ goin’ th’ pace generally.
And what the kid said about his father’s half-drownin’ ’im
in the bathtub every time he does somethin’ a little funny,
like every kid’s doin’ pretty near every day, is truth. Ole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
Ambrose says he’s seen ’im beat the kid half to death, and
then duck ’im on top o’ that. Don’t look like a bad kid
to me, either. Does he to you?”</p>

<p>“Not at all. On the contrary, he seems to me an exceptionally
kind and thoughtful boy. But he’s queer, George—there’s
no denying that. He has an old head on his
shoulders. I asked him: ‘But you really were deliberately
late for school, weren’t you?’ And he replied: ‘Yes,
ma’am.’ ‘Well,’ said I, ‘don’t you consider your school
work more important than watching slugs let themselves
down from chips, no matter how interesting that may be?’
And what do you think was his answer? He said: ‘No’m,
I don’t. It’s my business in this world to find out about
things like that. I study a lot, but not school books. I’m
not lazy in my head, if they do think so.’ Imagine, George,
a boy of fourteen talking like that—stating his ‘business in
this world!’ I tell you he’s a remarkable child, with those
grave, kind eyes of his that look you so directly in the
face.”</p>

<p>“Yes’m,” agreed George, not deeply moved by his wife’s
enthusiasm. “And say—I think th’ cops are lookin’ for
’im, ’Lizabeth. The fella at the skatin’ rink said two big
huskies were nosin’ ’round this mornin’, and they looked
to him like plainclothes men. He was wonderin’ what they
was up to, an’ when I told him a little about this kid he
said he’d bet they was huntin’ him. But I told ’im the
kid was all right and for him to keep his face closed, and
he said it wasn’t any business o’ his, and he would. But
what in th’ devil—I mean, what’re we gonta do about it?
We can’t afford to get mixed up in anythin’ like this,
’Lizabeth!”</p>

<p>His wife did not answer at once. She stood with her
dark head slightly bowed, a forefinger to her lips.</p>

<p>“Sometimes,” she said presently, as her husband came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
from the stable tent after leading in the ponies, “I think
it is best for a boy to get out and learn something of the
world. I didn’t use to think so before I married you, but
the camp life that I have led, here to-day, there to-morrow,
and encountering all sorts of men both young and old, has
changed me—made me more liberal. The educational system
of the schools is mostly wrong, I am convinced. Also
I believe that most parents are wrong in their attitude
toward their children. They don’t understand them and
don’t try to. They don’t realize their sensitiveness. They
don’t make any attempt to find out the trend of their
minds, and they force them to this and to that, and—”</p>

<p>“Yes’m—I guess that’s about right, ’Lizabeth. But it
ain’t tellin’ you an’ me what we’re gonta do about this
kid.”</p>

<p>“I know it isn’t,” she conceded. “And I must confess
that I have nothing in mind right now. I hate to see
him taken back to that brute of a father, and I hate to
see him run away and become a tramp. Which is just
what will happen if we set him adrift. Could we use him,
George?”</p>

<p>“I reckon we could,” said Bloodmop. “Never saw a
time yet about a camp that a fella couldn’t put a strong,
husky boy like that to work. The cook needs a helper, and
we can’t afford to hire him one. Camp cooks ’a’ got a way
o’ quittin’ unexpected, you know, when they begin to think
the work’s too heavy and it’s gettin’ to be a long time
between drinks. Yes, we could keep the kid busy pretty
near all day—but I couldn’t give ’im anythin’ but his
found.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll think it over to-day,” said his wife.</p>

<p>“Yes’m—an’ what you say goes”—and, whistling, the
light-hearted, hard-working gypo man started toward his
gang.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>But he turned back immediately. “Oh, ’Lizabeth!” he
called, and came swinging to her side again.</p>

<p>“This here boy,” he said, “has taken quite a fancy to
Madge, don’t you think? He’s gettin’ about the age when
they begin to think they’re good f’r somethin’ more’n to
have their hair yanked. An’ say—course I know they’re
only kids an’ all that—but ’twouldn’t be th’ worst thing
in th’ world that ever happened. The boy’s mother was a
Florence, they say, and th’ Florences are big folks in
Maryland. They got a pile o’ money, and, even if they did
turn a cold shoulder on this boy’s mother, that ain’t sayin’
they’ve forgot about her kids.”</p>

<p>“George! Aren’t you ashamed of yourself!”</p>

<p>Bloodmop Mundy’s face grew fiery red. “’Lizabeth, it
ain’t the money that I’m thinkin’ about so much. He
might never get a cent, and the chances are he won’t.
But you come of a good family, and I ain’t ever forgot it.
You run away with me, a no-’count tramp of a dirt-mover,
just because I said I’d be good to you an’ treat you right.
Well, I done that. That part’s all right. But I don’t know
nothin’ and never did—and never will. I’m just nobody—or
worse’n that, because I work but don’t get anywhere.
And it always hurt me to think that I drug you down to a
gypsy life like ours, an’—”</p>

<p>But here she laid a work-worn hand across his lips.</p>

<p>“Hush!” she said softly. “You do all the complaining,
George, and you’re only manufacturing reasons for complaint.”</p>

<p>“Well, anyway,” he laughed, “Sundays, when I shave
and dress up like, I ain’t so bad lookin’, am I? And I’m a
fightin’ fool! We’ll win out some day, ’Lizabeth. Wait’ll
we hit th’ West, where a man c’n swing his arms and hit a
lick that counts!”</p>

<p>But what her husband had said caused Elizabeth Mundy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
to think that morning. She knew her daughter pretty well.
Born in a gypo camp, raised with rough men from infancy,
Madge was not like other girls in her treatment of the few
boys that she met. She had never had a girl associate.
Men had babied her from her cradle. So it was only natural
that she could not feel the backwardness and restraint
that most young girls experience in their early dealings
with the opposite sex. She wanted no puppy-love affair
between these two, with Madge eleven and Joshua fourteen.
But for some unaccountable reason she had taken
a fancy to the boy and would have risked the difficulties
that might arise from their enforced close association in
the gypo camp, were she able to make herself believe it
just to take the runaway under her wing. And this last
was the problem that faced her during the day.</p>

<p>As for Madge and Joshua, they were together on the
grade all morning, after the girl had finished with her
studies. For two hours in the afternoon she would recite
to her mother in their remote little living tent. Then she
had promised to go “down the line” with him to see the
work of other camps on the double-tracking job.</p>

<p>The genial Bloodmop, born patron of boyish ambitions,
permitted Joshua to drive a team and to “stick pigs.” He
talked to the boy as if he were a man, and called him Josh
and slapped him familiarly on the back. And if there is
anything that warms the heart of a growing boy it is this
unconscious acceptance of him as a reasoning being by a
grown-up member of his sex. The three went in together
at noon, Bloodmop between the boy and girl, laughing
boisterously. During the afternoon, while Madge was busy
with her schooling, Bloodmop allowed Joshua to drive a
wheeler team, and took the time to explain many things
pertinent to the construction of railroads. When Madge
came she and Joshua wandered down the line. And after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
supper they had that delicious experience, the undisputed
due of young lovers since before the Egyptians builded the
Pyramids, of sitting side by side under the twinkling stars.</p>

<p>“Aren’t the stars bright to-night?” said Madge. “But
they say that out West they are brighter still. On the
desert, I believe. Oh, I’m just crazy to go West! And so
is Pa. He talks about it all the time. Look at that cluster
up there, almost over our heads. I call that the kite. And
there’s the big dipper”—she pointed—“I can always find
it.”</p>

<p>“What you call the kite,” said Joshua, “is the Constellation
of Orion. In March it’s just a little bit southwest of
right over a fella’s head. See those three stars in a line?
That’s called the Belt of Orion, and the three hanging down
like make the Sword of Orion. The Celestial Equator passes
through the belt. Now look at the four big stars that are
around the whole business. That red one is Betelgeuse, and
thatun closest to it is Bellatrix. Now look at the dim little
one in the middle of the Sword. Around that is the Nebula
of Orion, and the bright, white star is Rigel.”</p>

<p>“Mercy alive!” cried Madge. “Wherever did you learn
all that? Not at school, did you?”</p>

<p>“Naw, jest monkeyin’ ’round,” he said disparagingly.</p>

<p>“And do you know everything about the stars? Why,
I don’t know one from another.”</p>

<p>“I know a little,” he told her. “Some day I’m gonta
know more. Now look over there to the left. See that big
bright one? That’s Sirius, the Dog Star. Now look at the
Constellation of Orion again. Remember Rigel? Well, that
ain’t one star, but it’s two. It’s so far away’s what makes
it look to us like only one. And Number One in the Belt
of Orion and Number Three, too, are double stars.”</p>

<p>“Well, whoever heard of the like! I’ve always wanted
to know something about the stars, but I never had anybody<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
to tell me before. Nights and nights I sit outdoors and look
up at ’em and wonder. Some nights you can see millions
and millions of them, and then again—”</p>

<p>“No, you can’t,” he corrected her. “Folks used to think
that a fella couldn’t begin to guess how many stars he could
see. But we know better now. You can’t never see over
four thousan’. An’ about the most a fella’ll ever be able
to see is somewhere between two thousan’ an’ three thousan’.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe that!”</p>

<p>“Don’t haff to if ye don’t want to,” he said dogmatically.
“But I’m tellin’ you what’s what. I know what I’m talkin’
about.”</p>

<p>“Well, let’s not quarrel about it. I guess you ought to
know, but it looks funny to me. Tell me about the Big
Dipper. That’s my favorite.”</p>

<p>“Well,” he replied, “it ain’t particularly interestin’
to astronomers, I guess. But d’ye see that star that’s right
where you’d put your mouth if you was drinkin’ outa the
dipper, and holdin’ the handle straight in front of you?”</p>

<p>After a pause: “Yes, I guess I know the one you mean.”</p>

<p>“That’s what’s called the Pointer. No matter which way
the dipper turns, that star’s always pointing straight at
the Pole Star. There’s the Pole Star—see it over there,
with the Pointer pointin’at it?”</p>

<p>“Ye-yes—I guess so.”</p>

<p>“Five hundred centuries ago,” Joshua went on in a
dreamy tone, “the Big Dipper looked like a cross. And
five hundred centuries from now it’ll be in the shape of a
steamer chair.”</p>

<p>“How do they know that, Josh? Nobody that’s living
now was here five hundred centuries ago. And how ever
can they tell what it’ll look like five hundred centuries from
now? That sounds silly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>“There’s nothin’ silly about science,” Joshua told her
reprovingly. “Well, we know the direction that the stars
are goin’. And we know how fast they’re goin’. So it’s
easy to figger out where they were five hundred centuries
ago, and where they’ll be five hundred centuries from now.
And they’ll be just like I’m telling you. The Big Dipper’ll
look like a steamer chair. Why, lissen here, Madge: If the
fellas that built the hangin’ gardens of Babylon could come
back here now they wouldn’t notice hardly any difference
in the stars. The stars are travelin’ through space from
eight to ten miles a second, but if those ole fellas could
come back it would look like they’d moved only about half
the size of the moon. You know what I mean—half the size
that the moon looks like to us. Maybe half a foot, you’d
say. Millions o’ miles up there look like half a foot to us.”</p>

<p>“Gracious alive! That doesn’t seem possible. How far
is it up there, Josh? But o’ course nobody knows that.”</p>

<p>“I read where one fella said we were twenty-five million
million miles from the nearest star.”</p>

<p>“Twenty-five million million!” she gasped.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir—twenty-five million million miles. How’s that
sound to you? An’ lissen here: The sun and the planets—what
they call the solar system—are travelin’ through space
more’n a million miles a day. Right now you an’ me’s goin’
a million miles a day, Madge! Don’t it make you feel
dizzy? Well, we’re travelin’ more’n a million miles a day,
remember. Well, then, it would take us seventy thousan’
years to get to the nearest star.”</p>

<p>“Aw, you’re just makin’ that up, Josh! Pretty soon I’m
goin’ to ask you again, and I’ll bet you’ll forget how many
miles you said.”</p>

<p>“All right—try me,” invited Joshua.</p>

<p>“I will, all right. But tell me where we’re going so fast,
if you can.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>“I can’t do that. Nobody can, I guess. But I know the
direction that we’re travelin’ in. We’re travelin’ towards
a point between the Constellation of Lyra and the Constellation
of Hercules. There—see where I’m pointin’? That’s
about where we’re headed for. But you needn’t be pickin’
up your baggage or puttin’ on your hat, Madge. Remember
that it ud take us seventy thousan’ years to get to the
nearest star. But we ain’t travelin’ that way, it happens.
Why, just think! In ten minutes from now we’ll be seven
thousan’ miles from where we are in space this second!”</p>

<p>“It sounds perfectly awful, Josh,” she murmured. “It’s
kinda creepy, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“And by to-morrow evenin’,” he went on remorselessly,
“we’ll be more’n a million miles from the region of space
that we’re in right now. I remember readin’: ‘Prisoners
are we on a rudderless ship lost in an ocean of space, voyaging
we know not whither—truly symbolic of the spiritual
status of man.’”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t say anything more like that, Josh! I don’t
believe I understand it.”</p>

<p>“I do, kinda,” he told her. “I heard a lecturer say that,
and afterwards I read his book where he said it again.
And I committed it to memory; it sounded kinda nice, I
thought. And this here, too: ‘There where the glorious
Milky Way dips below the horizon lies the good ship
“Argo,” in which Jason and his fifty adventurers sailed
from Greece to recover the Golden Fleece. And we too
sail on this mystic ship, the earth, bound north-eastward
to an unknown port, perhaps to discover the Golden
Fleece of greater wisdom and “the peace that passeth
understanding.”’ I thought that was kinda pretty.”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh! You’re funny, Joshua. I don’t see why they
expelled you from school.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>“I wasn’t any good in grammar and ’rithmetic,” Joshua
explained in all simplicity. “And then—”</p>

<p>But here a hand fell upon his shoulder, and in the light
streaming from the dining tent he looked up into a pair
of piggish little eyes set in a heavy, florid face.</p>

<p>“I guess that’s about it, kid,” said a voice that somehow
matched the face. “And, besides that, you’re a bad actor
generally. Guess it’s about time you were goin’ home.
Uh-huh—black hair, heavy. Gray eyes, almost blue. Heavy
black eyebrows. Face like a girl’s, but well-built and
strong. Guess I’ve got you, all right.”</p>

<p>Madge and Joshua had sprung to their feet in amazement.
The man stood eyeing them, maintaining a tight
clutch on Joshua’s shoulder. Before either of the youthful
star-gazers could speak, a big, fat hand darted to the
inside pocket of Joshua’s coat and brought forth his father’s
razor in its case.</p>

<p>“Uh-huh! I was told I might find this on you. Well,
kid, yer dad wants you. Come on with me! And next
time you run away, don’t ask any switchman where to go.
Come on—it’s gettin’ late.”</p>

<p>“Is—is he arrested?” asked Madge in an awed little
voice.</p>

<p>“Uh-huh—sort of. C’m’on, kid.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br>

<small>JOSHUA WALKS WITH HIS FATHER</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">JOSHUA COLE’S home was alight when he and the
big detective entered the block. The plainclothes man
had talked with the boy all the way from the gypo
camp, and Joshua had found him a not unkindly person.
He himself had a boy and a girl, he said, but they gave
him little trouble. He had listened carefully while Joshua
told him that he had not appropriated the razor with intent
to use it as a weapon of offense or defense during his
travels Westward, but the detective could not believe the
story of the slug.</p>

<p>“Where d’ye get such confounded weird ideas, kid?”
he wanted to know, and repetition of the whys and wherefores
only brought forth laughter.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t blame you for runnin’ off that way,”
said the big fellow finally. “You’re a smart kid, if you
are a little queer, and your dad’s a no-good son-of-a-gun,
from what I’ve heard. But that’s between you an’ me—don’t
tell ’im I said it. It’d maybe get me into trouble.
But no matter how I feel about it, I gotta hang onto you—that’s
what I’m paid for. Say, where’d you learn all
that star racket? Gee! I don’t know when I’ve had as
much fun as listenin’ to you spoutin’ about the good ship
What-d’ye-call-it and all that!”</p>

<p>In silence the two climbed the steps of the Cole home,
and the detective pressed the bell button. Presently Zida
answered his ring, threw aloft her black hands, and rolled
her eyes.</p>

<p>“Lawd bless us, heah he is! Wheah yo’-all been all dis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
time, honey? Yo’ mothah done go purt’ neah wil’! Come
in heah dis minnit! Yo’ pappy drownd yo’, Ah reckon.”</p>

<p>“I wanta see Mr. Cole,” said the detective.</p>

<p>But before Zida could call him, John Cole, his dark face
as gloomy as a goblin’s, came into the hall.</p>

<p>“Here he is, Mr. Cole,” said the officer.</p>

<p>“Yes, so I see,” returned Cole with seeming cold indifference.
“Joshua, sit down there at the foot of the
stairs while I talk to this man. Zida, go back to the
kitchen.”</p>

<p>Both Zida and Joshua obeyed the ruthless voice, and
John Cole entered into low-voiced conversation with the detective.
This continued for perhaps a minute, while Joshua,
pale and suddenly deathly sick at his stomach, crouched on
the first step of the flight of stairs. Then the detective’s
voice began rising gradually, and the boy heard:</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you just this much, Mr. Cole: I don’t wanta
hear o’ your duckin’ that boy! I know all about it. Huntin’
’im up led me to several niggers that used to work for
you when you lived on Park Avenue, and all of ’em told
the same story. You ain’t got any right to treat a kid
like that, and if I find out you done it I’ll see what I c’n
do down at headquarters. That’s all I gotta say, but I
mean it. I got kids o’ my own, and I guess they ain’t any
better’n other ord’nary kids. But I never found it necessary
to hold their heads in a bathtub full o’ water until they
fainted.”</p>

<p>“I guess that will be about enough from you, officer,”
was John Cole’s dismissal of the man.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s all right. I ain’t lookin’ for trouble. But
I’m gonta tell the cop on this beat to keep his ears open
to-night, that’s all. I’ll make it hot for you if you try that
duckin’ racket to-night. That’s all—good-night.”</p>

<p>And the door closed after him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>Slowly John Cole turned to his son. For over half a
minute he stood eyeing him with cold savagery, then he
said crisply:</p>

<p>“Go up to your room, Joshua.”</p>

<p>“I—can’t I see Mother first?” pleaded the boy.</p>

<p>“Your mother has gone to bed, ill from worrying over
you. Go to your room, as I told you.”</p>

<p>Joshua got up and slowly climbed the stairs.</p>

<p>Lester and he had separate rooms, for the house was
large. Joshua wanted to talk with his brother, with some
one—any one—but he dared not disobey his father. In his
room he undressed slowly and, extinguishing the light,
climbed into bed. Soon he heard metallic sounds as his
door was locked, then dull footsteps as his father went
away. There he lay looking up into the blackness, fearful
that any moment he would hear the water running in the
bathroom and his father’s step at the door.</p>

<p>But the house remained silent, and the silence became
cruelly oppressive. When he could stand the suspense no
longer, he cautiously climbed out of bed, taking care that
no creak came from the springs, and went to a window.
Holding the shade aside, he found himself looking at blackness,
striped at intervals with the soft radiance of a starry,
moonlit night. The soft streaks of light, he found, came
in through cracks between heavy boards that had been
nailed across the window.</p>

<p>For hours after this he tossed about, and then fell suddenly
asleep. He was awakened by a knocking at his door,
and when he answered Zida came in with his breakfast on
a tray.</p>

<p>He questioned the old negress, for she was his friend,
but she had nothing to report. She had no knowledge of
what his father intended to do. He ate but little, and in
the midst of his meal his mother entered the room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>She took him in her arms, knelt beside his chair, and
sobbed brokenly. Then she arose, caressed his black hair,
and murmured, “My poor boy! My poor boy!” That
was all she said to him, for presently she tore herself away,
and, crying softly, went through the door and closed it
after her.</p>

<p>Then came Lester, and in low voices the brothers talked
for several minutes. Lester himself was to be confined to
his room during the entire period of his suspension from
school, but he had neither been whipped nor ducked. A
telegram to their father had brought him home when the
fickle Lester had told that Joshua was going West. Lester
did not know what was to be Joshua’s punishment; his
father had told him to go in and see his brother for a
minute or so, and then to return to his room. And in the
midst of their eager conversation John Cole’s voice was
heard ordering Lester back to his prison, and with a gulp
he hurried to obey. The key grated in the lock again after
Lester had left the room.</p>

<p>An hour of terrible suspense followed, and then Joshua
heard the key once more. The door opened and his father,
cold and merciless, stood in the doorway.</p>

<p>“Get your coat and cap,” he ordered. “We’re going
for a walk.”</p>

<p>Joshua joined his father in the upper hall. He followed
him silently down the stairs and through the front door.</p>

<p>“Step up beside me here,” came the command, as they
passed through the front gate and started along the sidewalk.</p>

<p>Nothing was said until they reached the business district—a
short walk from home. Here John Cole turned into a
retail hardware store, and Joshua followed.</p>

<p>“Sit down here,” said his father, indicating a chair.
“I want to have a talk with the owner of this store.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>Now Joshua thought he understood what was to be done
with him. He was to be taken from school, for good, perhaps,
because he was a failure, and placed in a hardware
store to learn his father’s business. Well, though he had
no taste for business, that was better than being half
drowned—better than returning to Old Madmallet next
season, a year behind in his studies.</p>

<p>He sat there obediently, gray-blue eyes traveling over the
store, while his father talked with a fat man in shirt-sleeves.
Frequently he heard his father’s voice lifted in
laughter, and once he saw him slap the hardware man good-naturedly
on the back. What a different man he was,
thought Joshua, when dealing with people not connected
with his family. The two parted presently with a hearty
handclasp, and Joshua followed his father into the street
again.</p>

<p>Side by side they continued their journey, and Joshua,
believing that there was no opening for him in the hardware
store they had just left, wondered where they were
going now. Five blocks farther on they entered a second
hardware store, where a similar performance took place.</p>

<p>But again Joshua was not called to meet the proprietor,
as he had fully expected he would be, and once more the
uncommunicative pair resumed their sauntering.</p>

<p>There followed one more similar call, which to Joshua
seemed as fruitless of results as had been the previous ones,
and then again they walked away together. And now, coming
suddenly abreast a large brick building, his father said:</p>

<p>“Let’s go in here a minute.”</p>

<p>Side by side they climbed a short flight of wide stone
stairs. Ahead of them and above them were great glass
doors in an arched doorway. John Cole turned the knob
of one of them, and stood back for Joshua to enter first.</p>

<p>Joshua went in, to find himself gazing at a blue-coated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
policeman, with white chevrons on his arm, seated behind
a high, dark wood desk, busily writing in a large, flat book.
There was a low railing before the desk, and on Joshua’s
side of it three more policemen lounged in office chairs.</p>

<p>John Cole stepped before the high desk, and the man
behind it looked at him inquiringly.</p>

<p>“You remember me, Sergeant,” said John Cole.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes—Mr. Cole,” said the officer. “And this is the
boy, is it?” And his keen, quizzical eyes coasted over
Joshua from head to feet. “Um! Bad actor, is he? Um!...
Well, Mr. Cole, you can go right up to the court
room. There’s not much doing this morning.”</p>

<p>The sergeant spoke to one of the lounging policemen, and
this man motioned to John Cole and led the way out into
the corridor. Joshua followed his father, who lagged behind
when outside in the long hall, allowing Joshua to catch
up with him.</p>

<p>“Now, listen,” he said in a voice so low that the policeman
ahead of them could not hear: “When you stand before
the judge I want you to tell him that you are willing
to do what I want you to. Do you understand?”</p>

<p>“I—I guess so,” faltered Joshua.</p>

<p>“Because,” said his father, “if you don’t, you know
what’s awaiting you at home. Think it over before we
reach the court room. Make your choice. And remember
this: What I have done to you in the past won’t be worth
considering to what I’ll do to you if you are left with me.”</p>

<p>Joshua was bewildered, of course. He hardly realized
what it was all about, it had happened so suddenly. But
there was no doubt in his mind as to the deep threat in his
father’s words, and a cold fear took hold on him as he
thought again of the bathtub filled with water, the nightmare
of his young life.</p>

<p>The police judge was a short, fat man, very brisk and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
businesslike, with fair skin, blond hair, and big blue eyes
that somehow seemed to gaze in an odd surprise at all that
came before them. There was little ceremony to what followed,
and there were no preliminaries at all. Almost before
he knew it Joshua was facing those surprised blue
eyes, and the judge was looking him over as if he were some
strange new animal just captured.</p>

<p>“Well, well, well!” he said in an oily tone. “Incorrigible,
eh? Won’t study and disobeys the rules. And he
stole his father’s razor when he ran away. Incorrigible!
Young man, don’t you know that you are incorrigible?”</p>

<p>“Ye-yes, sir,” answered Joshua. He did not know what
incorrigible meant, but he knew the blackness that came
with being all but drowned in a bathtub filled with water.</p>

<p>“Tk-tk-tk!” clucked the judge. “And you can do nothing
with him at all, Mr. Cole?”</p>

<p>“I’m away from home most of the time, as I told you,”
said John Cole. “And his mother is not well, and can’t
handle him at all. Why, didn’t he threaten to strike his
teacher with a heavy iron poker? And he was so—er—desperately
in earnest that Mr. Madmallet, a grown man
and used to handling boys, was actually afraid to punish
this boy’s brother.”</p>

<p>“Tk-tk-tk! Well, they’ll take a good deal of that out of
him at the House of Refuge, Mr. Cole. My boy”—to
Joshua—“have you any reason to state why you should
not be committed to an institution for the disciplining of
incorrigible boys like you?”</p>

<p>But before Joshua could reply he heard a low voice beside
him saying:</p>

<p>“Tell ’im yes, kid! Tell ’im you’ll be good and that you
don’t wanta go.”</p>

<p>Joshua’s frightened eyes fell on the big plainclothes detective<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
who had found him at the gypo camp of Bloodmop
Mundy.</p>

<p>“Oh, here you are, Dickinson,” said the judge. “And
they tell me you found this razor on young Joshua Cole
here. Is that correct?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, he had it in his inside coat pocket,” replied
the detective. “But I think he just took it in fun. He
told me all about it—somethin’ about makin’ one o’ these
slugs walk on it or somethin’ like that. Just kid play, I’m
thinkin’. If you’ll permit a suggestion, Your Honor, I’d
advise lookin’ into this matter pretty careful before committin’
this boy to the House of Refuge.”</p>

<p>“I have the sworn testimony of the boy’s father that he
cannot be disciplined,” said the judge. “Mr. Cole is away
a great part of the time, traveling as a salesman for a
wholesale hardware firm. The mother is not well, and finds
it impossible to make the boy behave. He is a thief, behind
in his studies—though apparently bright enough—and a
terror to the neighborhood. Aren’t all these things true,
Joshua?”</p>

<p>Joshua looked at the commanding eyes of his father and
said, “Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“And don’t you think it would be a good thing for you
to be committed to the House of Refuge until you are
twenty-one?”</p>

<p>Seven years! “Yes, sir,” replied the boy, as if hypnotized
by the warning in his father’s steadfast gaze.</p>

<p>“Then I will commit you,” said the judge. “Mr. Cole,
you will swear to a warrant.”</p>

<p>Some time later, as John Cole, the commitment papers
in his pocket, and Joshua entered the broad corridor they
found Dickinson, the big detective, pacing up and down.</p>

<p>“Well,” he remarked, “all fixed, eh?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>Cole nodded briefly.</p>

<p>“Sure you c’n get him out to the House of Refuge by
yourself, are you?”</p>

<p>John Cole turned on the man, but Dickinson’s face was
a blank.</p>

<p>“Are you trying to make fun of me?” asked Cole. “If
you are, I’ll make trouble for you.”</p>

<p>“Who, me? Why, no, Mr. Cole. I just asked you if
you needed any help in takin’ the boy out there. I could
get a couple o’ policemen to go with you, you know, and
then you’d be pretty safe. But o’ course if you c’n handle
’im, all well an’ good.”</p>

<p>“You’re a little impertinent, aren’t you?” asked Cole.</p>

<p>“Oh, no—not at all. But it’s my duty to try and keep
the peace at all times. Just offerin’ my help.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s not needed,” snapped John Cole, well knowing
that he was being ridiculed, but helpless to make a
complaint that Dickinson was doing more than offering his
services in good faith.</p>

<p>“Well, so-long, kid,” said the detective, as John Cole
started on again. “Be good out there, and they’ll parole
you in about a year.”</p>

<p>“You mind your own business,” raged Cole.</p>

<p>But Dickinson kept on: “Just obey the rules, kid, no
matter what happens. And always tell the truth. It’s the
only way to make the best of a bad bargain. Don’t fight
back. Stand for anythin’ they hand you, and you’ll win
out in the end. So-long!”</p>

<p>And then John Cole and Joshua reached the entrance
and passed out through the great glass doors.</p>

<small>NUMBER 5635</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THEY rode in a street car to the furthermost outskirts
of the city. At the end of the line they left
the car and walked three blocks toward a high brick
fence with iron spikes on top, above which loomed large
brick buildings in the center of a vast inclosure. They
were met at the entrance by a gate-keeper, who directed
John Cole to the superintendent’s office. While his father
attended to the business in hand Joshua, wide-eyed and
wondering, remained in an anteroom. Now and then, in
a large, painfully clean room off this anteroom, he saw
boys of about his own age and older moving about quietly,
dressed in gray suits with brass buttons and red stripes
down the trousers legs, little black cloth skull caps, and
heavy brogans.</p>

<p>Very soon he was called into the office proper and stood
before the superintendent, a tall, grave man with unhealthy
white skin and veiny hands. With a brief “Good-by,
Joshua,” John Cole left his son; and then the superintendent
sat looking the boy over in a disinterested though not
antagonistic manner.</p>

<p>“Cole,” he mused finally, looking at the papers before
him on his desk. “John Cole is your father’s name? It is
strangely familiar. Do you know your mother’s maiden
name”—he glanced at the paper again—“Joshua?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” replied Joshua. “It was Florence.”</p>

<p>“Florence! Are you positive?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir—I know that was her name.”</p>

<p>“Impossible! What is her first name?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>“Blanche,” said the boy.</p>

<p>“Blanche Cole. I suspected it the moment I saw your
face, but it didn’t occur to me while your father was here.
You have the face of a Florence. So your mother was a
Florence. One of <i>the</i> Florences, of course.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. There’s lots of Florences in this state. They
come over with Lord Calvert to Maryland.”</p>

<p>“Of course—of course. The irony of fate! Do you know,
Joshua, that your mother’s father—your grandfather, Peter
D. Florence—was the founder of this institution?”</p>

<p>“No, sir—I never heard o’ that.”</p>

<p>The superintendent stared at Joshua until he was vastly
uncomfortable, but the fact is that the man did not see
the boy before him at all. Presently he roused himself,
assumed a businesslike attitude, and began a string of platitudes
to the effect that Joshua would profit by obeying all
of the rules and regulations. This in a droning, parrotlike
voice, and when he had finished he pressed a bell button
and a boy much older than Joshua, dressed in uniform,
came into the room. He stood waiting while the superintendent
scribbled a note and folded it.</p>

<p>“This is Number Fifty-six thirty-five,” said the superintendent.
“Take him in hand and outfit him. Then turn
him over to the Juvenile Department, and give this note to
Mr. Clegg.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said the monitor, and looked toward Joshua
to indicate that he was to follow him.</p>

<p>In a stuffy room in the main building, where there were
great piles of uniforms on curtain-protected shelves, the
monkey-capped boy and two assistants outfitted the newcomer,
causing him to strip, whereupon they made caustic
remarks about his bared anatomy. They rifled his pockets,
found a pocket knife, and quarreled over it among themselves.
The new ownership finally settled upon, they deposited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
Joshua’s old clothes in a locker, and while he was
donning the new the largest of the boys smacked him
smartly on the bare body with the flat of his hand and
enjoined him to make greater speed. Joshua turned, the
battle fire of his fighting ancestors in his gray-blue eyes.
His fists doubled, and he assumed an attitude of defense,
while the three monitors grinned at him tantalizingly.
Then Joshua remembered the words of Detective Dickinson:
“Don’t fight back. Stand for anything they hand
you, and you’ll win out in the end.” So, while the three
old-timers laughed and winked, he backed up against the
wall and continued his dressing. It was alum-bitter medicine,
but already he was planning how to run away and
continue his interrupted journey westward. He dared not
fight back and perhaps jeopardize his chances of escape.</p>

<p>When he was ready he was taken through long corridors
and out at a side door, thence across a wide space of ground
to another brick building. Here, before long, Joshua found
himself in the presence of Mr. Beaver Clegg, head of the
Juvenile Department.</p>

<p>Mr. Beaver Clegg, Joshua thought, was the owner of the
ugliest face he had ever seen on a human being. He was
thin, but not exceptionally tall. He wore a baggy gray
suit, and his linen, in its soiled state, did not set a good
example for his wards. Joshua looked at him curiously as
he read the note from the superintendent. He noticed the
nose, twisted to one side, and bumpy at the end; the curious
eyes, neutral in color but inclining toward slate-blue, and
cocked out of all proportion, one of them appearing much
smaller than the other and set lower in the face; the thick
lips, corrugated and crooked, contrasting strangely with
the bony face; the square, hairless jaw; the swarthy, mottled
skin.</p>

<p>But when this ugliest of men looked up at Joshua and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
smiled a great transformation took place. The colorless
eyes seemed to glow with warmth. The twisted lips somehow
seemed to straighten miraculously, and there was nothing
hideous about the big, yellow uneven teeth that showed
between them. Joshua was reminded of the face of Abraham
Lincoln, that tall, gaunt man whose very homeliness
endears him to the heart of the nation that he served.
Joshua did not know it until later, but he had been placed
in the care of Beaver Clegg simply because his mother had
been a Florence. He rightly belonged in a department for
older wards, but the superintendent knew his subordinates,
and had conferred this boon upon the son of the daughter
of the founder of the institution.</p>

<p>“Well, Joshua,” said Mr. Clegg, in a voice that went
with his face when the smile was upon it, “what have you
been up to? Sit down there and tell me all about it.
Don’t be backward; don’t be afraid. Just begin at the
beginning and tell me the truth. And with me, Joshua,
the truth always pays. But more of that later. Now tell
me your story. You’ll be talking to your friend.”</p>

<p>It was a long story, and at first the boy talked haltingly.
But as he saw the deep, kindly interest in Clegg’s eyes, as
he leaned his elbows on the desk and cupped his battle-ship
chin in his bony hands, his confidence grew and he talked
more freely. When he began speaking of the adventure
with the slug Mr. Clegg suddenly scraped forward his chair
and leaned closer. His eyes seemed to grow darker and
darker until their indifferent blue had changed to a deep,
velvety purple, as a cat’s eyes change with its varying
moods.</p>

<p>“Just a moment,” he interrupted finally. “You say that
a stream of mucilaginous substance—something like that—came
from the slug, and that it let itself down to the
ground by means of it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>“Yes, sir,” said Joshua. “It’s just the color o’ tapioca
puddin’.”</p>

<p>“Well, well, well! I never knew that before. Go on!
Go on! Tell me about the experiment with the razor.”</p>

<p>Joshua began it, but was once more interrupted. Clegg’s
tones were eager as he spoke, and Joshua marveled not a
little at his interest.</p>

<p>“The entire under side of a slug or a snail, Joshua,” he
said, “comprises a walking surface. One might term his
whole belly a foot. This walking surface clings to one side
of the razor blade, as the slug extends its fore part and
bends down over the other side. He is not crawling upon
the sharp part at all, you see, but it appears as if he is
doing so. Where did you learn about all this?”</p>

<p>“Aw, I’m always monkeyin’ ’round with somethin’ like
that,” said Joshua. “I kinda like it. I’m gonta be a
scientist some day. But they wouldn’t let me do anythin’
at school. I got a dandy collection o’ birds’ eggs, and a lot
o’ bugs and pressed leaves, and snakes in alcohol.”</p>

<p>“A scientist, eh? And what branch do you prefer?”</p>

<p>“I ain’t just sure yet. I like all of it that I’ve read
about. But I guess I like astronomy more’n anythin’.”</p>

<p>Clegg’s eyes grew darker. “Astronomy—yes, yes! And
what do you know about astronomy, Joshua?”</p>

<p>“Not much. But I’ve read some books. And I c’n pick
out a lotta stars and planets easy, and I know what their
names are an’ everything like that.”</p>

<p>Here a mellow gong sounded, and Beaver Clegg’s eyes
grew neutral in color once more. “That’s the dinner
gong,” he said briskly. “I’ll call one of the monitors,
who will show you how to fall in and march to the
washroom, and afterward to the dining room. After dinner
there will be fifteen minutes for play, and I want you to
come back here for that period. I want to talk more with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
you.” He pressed a button, and a uniformed monitor
came in. “This is Fifty-six thirty-five,” said Mr. Clegg.
“Take care of him until he learns the rules. That’s all for
the present, Fifty-six thirty-five.”</p>

<p>Joshua marched to the washroom, a large, spotlessly
clean compartment where each boy used his individual
basin, which hung under a tag bearing his number. When
they left the washroom they marched across the court yard
to the main building, where was the dining room. Here
the inmates of the entire institution partook of their meals,
boys from the North Wing, between the ages of eighteen
and twenty, those from the South Wing, from fourteen to
eighteen, and those of fourteen or under from Mr. Clegg’s
Juvenile Department. The dining room monitor seated
Joshua, and he ate sparingly of soup, coffee, bread without
butter, boiled ham, and beans. The dining room was silent
as a tomb, as no conversation was allowed. When the
meal was finished they rose at a command from the monitor
and were marched out into the playground. Here Joshua
contrived to evade curious and semi-pugnacious boys who
wanted to know all about him, entered the gray corridor of
the Juvenile Department, and found his way again to the
little office of Beaver Clegg.</p>

<p>Mr. Clegg wore large round spectacles now, for he had
been reading. Over the rims of them he looked at Joshua
speculatively for a time.</p>

<p>“You will be known here as Fifty-six thirty-five,” he said
finally. “But when you and I are alone together I’m
going to call you Joshua. It seems, almost, that a special
Providence sent you to me, and I have hopes that your life
here will be more profitable to you than if you had stayed
at home. You are very young to have decided upon a
career, and who knows but that you will change your
mind entirely before you are a year older? I recall that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
when I was about your age I was determined to become a
minister of the gospel. I had preached a little even then—if
one might call it preaching—and was hailed as a boy
evangelist. But now I am interested in other matters, and
have been since I was twenty-one.</p>

<p>“Let us assume, however, that you are interested in
astronomy and want to become a serious student. You are
too young to understand, of course—but I may as well tell
you now that it is a calling that demands the utmost sacrifice.
There’s no money in it, Joshua, or I would not be
here at the head of the Juvenile Department in a boys’ reformatory.
For that is just what this institution has degenerated
to—a reformatory—though your grandfather,
Peter D. Florence, had no such thing in mind when he
founded it. It was to be a home for parentless boys and
other unfortunate youngsters. But your grandfather is
dead, and the institution is in the hands of a board of
directors and a superintendent who have failed to catch
the spirit of your grandfather’s generosity.</p>

<p>“Be that as it may, you will be none the worse off if
you are diligent and obey the rules. I say this because
I know something of your father, the man whom your
mother gave up everything to marry. Here you will learn
the common school branches as well as you could outside,
and on top of that I am going to give you your first lessons
in astronomy.”</p>

<p>Clegg did not heed the boy’s parted lips nor the eager
brilliancy in his grave young eyes, but continued:</p>

<p>“It seems to me to be a marvelous coincidence that you
found your way to me. For the past twenty years, Joshua,
I have studied the stars. I am what is known as a variable
star observer, and I have a three-inch refractor which I
use at night on the roof of this building. None of the other
officials in the school are in sympathy with me, but they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
tolerate me. They are second-graders intellectually, all of
them, or they would not be here. I am here to make a living
while I follow my studies, for, as I told you, Science is an
indifferent paymaster.</p>

<p>“If I may be pardoned for the statement, I am not altogether
unknown to the scientific world. Joshua, have you
any knowledge of the variable stars?”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” replied Joshua, a little awed that he was in
intimate conversation with a real astronomer, one who
owned a telescope. Would he be allowed to look through it,
he wondered? Never in his life had he looked through any
instrument larger than a pair of opera glasses.</p>

<p>“There are hundreds of stars,” Mr. Clegg went on,
“that are known to vary in brightness. In a few cases the
causes of this variability are known. There are, for instance,
the Algol Variables. In their case, the variability
is readily accounted for by the theory of a dark, eclipsing
body, smaller than the primary, and traveling round it in
an orbit lying nearly edgewise to us. The two bodies revolve
round their common center of gravity. In the case
of other types of variables we are still uncertain, or quite
in the dark, regarding what is really happening to cause
the change in brightness.”</p>

<p>Clegg did not see his listener now. His near-blue eyes
were darkening to velvet-purple again, and his vision took
in worlds far off in space. Joshua listened in a sort of
breathless rapture, though he had small idea of what it
was all about.</p>

<p>“Observations of these perplexing bodies, continuing over
a long period of time,” Clegg went on dreamily, forgetting
that his audience was only a fourteen-year-old boy, “will
eventually afford a sufficiently large collection of facts on
which to base a satisfactory theory of what causes the
observed variation. Out of the hundreds studied by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
nearly two hundred members—mostly amateurs like myself—of
the International Society of Variable Star Observers,
of which I am one, who have contributed a startling
number of observations during the past few years, certain
stars may be discovered whose peculiar behavior will lead
to a true understanding of these interesting bodies. I
myself, if you will pardon me once more, have added my
share of discoveries to this great work.</p>

<p>“So that is really my business in life, Joshua. It is a
work of love, as the society pays nothing in money to any
of its members. And, as I told you, I occupy my position
here to gain a livelihood while pursuing my hobby, as my
critics term my work. My fellow-instructors are out of
tune with me, and even go so far as to ridicule me at times.
But as the superintendent considers me harmless, and as
I try to perform my school duties faithfully, he does not
interfere with my astronomical work, which I never allow
to conflict with the regular routine. But mine is a lonesome
existence. I have longed for some one close to me who is
moved by the inspiring grandeur of the heavenly bodies.
I have been told that I am a born teacher, but I prefer to
teach the things that interest me. You wanted to study
science and they refused you. So you see, Joshua, that
you and I have a great deal in common. And it will be my
delight to make an effort to ground you in the science of
astronomy, if you are willing to learn and will help me by
observing the rules and regulations of the school, and attempting
to master what the directors have prescribed as a
course for the institution. I am not altogether unselfish
in this offer. I want to teach somebody what I have learned,
for I love it and find boundless pleasure in telling others
what I know. But there has been no one to tell. And how
it will refresh my own fund of knowledge! How does my
offer appeal to you, Joshua?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>“It’d be mighty nice,” replied Fifty-six thirty-five,
almost unable to believe that here was an opportunity that
he had not expected to present itself until he had become
a man and master of his destiny.</p>

<p>“I’ll do anything you say, Mr. Clegg,” he promised.
“I’m sure much obliged.”</p>

<p>Clegg’s whimsical smile rested upon him in a fatherly
way. “You’ll never have occasion to regret it,” he said.</p>

<p>Then the great gong sounded, and the hour of play was
at an end.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br>

<small>TRUTH AND HONOR</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">FROM one o’clock till four in the afternoon that first
day Number Fifty-six thirty-five gave heed to the
mechanism of a sewing machine, and mended the
rent clothes of the inmates. A large, rather kindly woman
was matron over him. By four o’clock he was doing fairly
well, and in a week’s time was accomplishing his simple
machine sewing with speed and neatness. And this became
his allotted task. From four to six o’clock the boys were
allowed to play in the great yard, and here they were as
uproarious and irrepressible as Old Madmallet’s flock at
home. They marched to the washroom at six again, and
thence once more to the dining room, where they ate tea,
bread and apple-sauce. From seven to nine they studied
the common branches of learning in the schoolroom, presided
over by that ugliest of men, the Lincoln-like Beaver
Clegg. At nine they went to bed, each in his clean little
iron cot, with its crackling straw mattress. Almost immediately
Mr. Clegg came in, listened to the monitors’
reports of the boys’ behavior during the day, and extinguished
the lights.</p>

<p>For fifteen minutes now the wards of the Juvenile Department
were allowed to talk and tell stories. Joshua, because
he was new and might have something fresh to offer,
was called upon for a yarn, story-telling being a favorite
diversion of the inmates. So well did he acquit himself,
drawing without reserve upon his vivid imagination because
he was in total darkness and not obliged to face his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
listeners, that his effort was hailed with a round of applause.
Later he became official story-teller of the department,
and when he had learned more of astronomy from
Clegg’s teachings, he evolved wondrous and fantastic tales
of adventures in the planets, which were the delight of
his fellow-inmates. A gong sounded at fifteen minutes after
nine, and Joshua, in the middle of a story that had for
its main characters a boy and a girl who traveled West
in a converted boxcar, with a flatcar back yard coupled on
next to it, was ordered to “dry up” by the head monitor.
And soon after the soft, regular breathing of the very human
little prisoners of the House of Refuge came from all
quarters of the room.</p>

<p>But Fifty-six thirty-five lay awake, staring up into the
blackness, and thought of a girl with reddish-golden hair
and Oriental-topaz eyes. And he was sore of heart, and
the stiff white pillow under his head was moist. Then a
hand softly touched him and he heard the guarded words:</p>

<p>“Quiet, Joshua! Don’t make a sound. Get up softly
and join me at the door. We’re going up on the roof to
view the moon.”</p>

<p>Walking noiselessly in his new bed slippers, Joshua Cole
found the entrance to the sleeping quarters, where Clegg
awaited him. The instructor led him to a remote part of
the building, where they passed through a door, and Joshua
struck his toes against the foot of a flight of stairs. Clegg
closed the door behind them and lighted a candle, the
flickering blaze of which revealed a closed staircase leading
to what in nautical parlance would be called a booby hatch
in the flat roof.</p>

<p>The night was bright with stars, and a big half-moon rode
in the heavens to guard them. Already Clegg had preceded
his pupil with the telescope, and had adjusted it on its
tripod.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>“Joshua,” said Clegg, in tones a trifle below normal, “I
want you to understand in the beginning that I am
breaking the rules in taking you from your bed. But I
have considered the matter carefully and have reached the
decision that, in this case, I am entitled to make my own
rules. So long as we shall be engaged in an undertaking
that is praiseworthy, we shall be our own judges concerning
what is right and wrong. But I want you to fully understand
the confidence that I am placing in you and the
risk that I am taking. Do you think you do?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” the boy replied. “I won’t tell anybody.”</p>

<p>“And I think that I can safely trust you,” said the
master. “I thought so from the first, or such an amazing
idea never would have occurred to me. You have made
an unprecedented impression on me, Joshua, and it seems
unbelievable that I should bring you up here the night of
your first day in the institution. But I have done so, and
here you are. I perhaps should have waited until I know
you better; but to-night, of all nights in the month, is
the best for observing the moon. We have a nine-and-three-quarter-day
moon to-night, Joshua, and I felt that
the opportunity ought not to be put off for an entire month.
But repetition of to-night’s—er—adventure, we’ll call it—will
depend on how you conduct yourself in school and with
the other boys. Do you understand that thoroughly?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said Joshua.</p>

<p>“You must study and learn things that are distasteful
to you during regular class hours. That will be the price
of your lessons in astronomy. Can you make that sacrifice?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Very well, then—we’ll see. Now place your eye to the
eye-piece, and we’ll have a look at the moon.”</p>

<p>Joshua, at once eager and filled with awe, placed his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
eye to the eye-piece. He caught his breath in boyish
ecstasy as the great tinfoil half-moon, chewed to lacelike
filaments on its east and southeast sides, was revealed to
him as he never before had seen it. Immovable, absolutely
silent, he gazed in rapture, and all the mysticism of the
universe wrapped itself about him. He saw the wondrous
craters, the mountains, the sea bottoms, the plains, and his
fancy peopled them with strange adventurers bent on
stranger quests—dream people who lived dream lives and
sought dream marvels in a land whose fabric was dreams.</p>

<p>“You perhaps are not aware, Joshua,” Clegg was saying
softly in his stilted, academic way, “that you are seeing
the moon upside down, in the natural way that we see all
objects. Do you know that whatever you see in this world
you see upside down? But your eyes have adjusted themselves,
and they really appear to you as rightside up. This
is known to the science of optics by reason of men born
blind suddenly regaining their sight, when their unadjusted
eyes see objects upside down. Don’t ask me to
explain it, for it is out of my field. But remember that,
as you now see the moon, north is south, and east is west.</p>

<p>“Now, the dark areas that you see, Joshua, are flat plains
and sea bottoms. The bright areas are mountainous
regions. There are nine mountain chains on that portion
of the moon which is visible to us earth-dwellers. (And
the most that we ever see of the moon’s surface is about
forty-seven per cent.) These nine mountain chains contain
some three thousand peaks, many of them between
fifteen thousand and twenty thousand feet in height.
Though you are not able to see it now, there is a mountain-peak
on the southern edge of the moon which is thirty-six
thousand feet high. Mount Everest, as you probably
remember from your study of geography, is twenty-nine
thousand feet in height, and is this planet’s closest approach<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
to the gigantic moon-mountain of which I speak.
Do you follow me, Joshua?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Now observe that large crater in the south polar region,
Joshua. Where will you look for it?”</p>

<p>“’Way up on top, to the right—I mean, to the east?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s right—you are quick to comprehend. But
remember, now, that in reality that region is far to the
south and west. Have you found the crater—by far the
largest to be seen?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir—I think so.”</p>

<p>“What does it resemble? Do you see the smaller craters
within the walls of the larger one?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir—I see ’em. And the one around ’em looks
like where they vaccinated me on the arm, when the place
where the doctor scratched got sore and was all eaten out.”</p>

<p>“Exactly, Joshua! Fine! A remarkable comparison.
Well, Joshua, you are observing the largest of the craters
that are known to be on the moon. This is the immense
walled plain of Clavius. It is a hundred and forty-three
miles at its greatest length, and its floor covers an area
of sixteen thousand square miles. The State of Rhode
Island would scarcely cover its interior area. The crater-studded
walls about it have an elevation of seventeen thousand
feet, which is more than a thousand feet higher than
the summit of Mont Blanc, the highest mountain in Europe.</p>

<p>“Now just a little above the center of the exposed area—er—of
that portion of the moon which is revealed to-night—you
will see Tycho quite plainly. This is another immense
crater, fifty-four miles in diameter, and with a depth
of seventeen thousand feet. Lifting its summit from this
immense pit is a central mountain, which rises to an elevation
of six thousand feet. Do you follow me, Joshua?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir—I guess so.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>Mr. Clegg became forgetful of his surroundings, forgetful
of his pupil. Carried away by his own lecture-like recital
of the wonders viewed by Joshua, he went on rapidly:</p>

<p>“There you view high walls and peaks thousands of feet
above the level of the surface. They catch the first gleams
of the rising sun, while many deep abysses yet remain in
somber lunar night. Many of the dish-shaped plains of this
rugged region, once huge pots of boiling rock or lava, are
distinguished by no black shadows, having been refilled to
the rims; though a few of them still retain walls high
enough to throw black shadows eastward on the plains.
Conspicuous against the southeastern wall of Clavius is
the vast black hole of the ring-mountain Blancanus, fifty
miles in diameter, at the bottom of whose abysmal cavity
no sunlight has ever shone—the deepest, most cavernous
pit known to man. Were the highest mountain-peak on
the earth—Mount Everest—standing on the forever darkened
floor of this pit, its lofty summit would rise but five
thousand feet above the ramparts of the encircling mountain-ring;
for the black hole is approximately twenty-four
thousand feet in depth—about four thousand feet deeper
than Mount McKinley is high.”</p>

<p>Thus he talked on and on until young Joshua’s mind
was a confused blank, though his soul was leaping with
happiness. And when at last the master came down to
earth and remarked that the hour was late, Joshua followed
him down the dark stairway without a word.</p>

<p>“Go back to your bed,” whispered Clegg as they reached
the foot of the flight. “To-morrow I shall give you photographs
of the various regions of the moon and lend you
Flammarion’s <i>Astronomy</i>. Be patient, Joshua—you will
learn all that I know, and much more when you become
a man. That’s all for the present, Fifty-six thirty-five.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>That was the beginning of it. Now the boy Joshua,
robbed of his heritage, had a goal to work for, and he
worked. Learning the common school branches that he
detested was the necessary means to a glorious end, and
before long he had proved to Clegg’s unbounded satisfaction
that with him the study of science was no mere boyish
whim. No other reward could have been offered which
would have caused him to apply himself so assiduously to
arithmetic, grammar, and other distasteful branches. More,
he withstood many temptations to enter into youthful
pranks with the other boys, and when he stood aloof repeatedly
they grew to consider him a “mamma’s boy,” and
treated him accordingly. In that day the word “tony”
stood in slang as an adjective to describe one who considered
himself above the common herd, and it soon was applied
to the young astronomer. They called him Tony
among themselves, but functionally he remained Fifty-six
thirty-five to his last day in the House of Refuge.</p>

<p>The fact that he was studious and diligently obeyed the
rules and regulations of the school brought him a T-and-H
medal at the first meeting of the board of directors after
his commitment, and T and H meant Truth and Honor.
But the medal brought him more trouble than satisfaction,
for it placed him above his fellow-inmates in the Juvenile
Department and filled their young hearts with scorn and
rancor. From the presentation day onward Joshua’s lot
was a hard one. He was “framed” repeatedly—dark plots
were laid for his undoing. Time and again he was inveigled
into compromising situations, skillfully designed to get him
into trouble and to break his record. But the word of a
T-and-H boy was accepted until he himself had proved
that he was unworthy to wear the medal. Joshua was
shoved, slapped, pinched, kicked stealthily, and twice a
ruffianly youth much older than himself deliberately spat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
in his face in an effort to madden him to the point of
resentment with his fists.</p>

<p>But for the sake of his promise to his benefactor Beaver
Clegg, and for the sake of the scientific knowledge that he
longed to have, he endured and suffered. Joshua was a
fiery tempered lad—a fighter—to which many an old
schoolmate in the bygone days of Silvanus Madmallet could
attest. Never before had he allowed himself to be bullied
and browbeaten, but so great was his love for the mystic
nights on the roof with Clegg that he willingly made the
sacrifice. He was being tempered in the fire of life and,
though he did not realize it, was building up a character
which was to become proof against the pettishness of human
nature in after years. When the second meeting of the
board of directors was called, Joshua was sent for. In the
superintendent’s office he stood before a body of grave-faced
wiseacres, and, to his surprise, he found that he
knew several of them. They asked him many questions,
inquired into his record, and in the end informed him
that he would be paroled when his first year was over.
They sent him back during the play hour; and then it was
that Joshua Cole performed one of the most extraordinary
feats of his boyhood.</p>

<p>A ball game was in progress in the playgrounds. Joshua
looked eagerly about as he drew near the players, and
presently his glance alighted on Number Twenty-three
forty-four, a boy older and larger than himself, the one
who had spat in his face, willing to suffer punishment himself
if he could induce Joshua to fight. Straight toward
him walked Number Fifty-six thirty-five, and when he
reached him he stood before him and regarded him with
his grave, gray-blue eyes, in which an intense fire now
flashed.</p>

<p>“Kid,” he said, “I’m goin’ to whip you for spittin’ in
my face three months ago. Get ready—I’m comin’!”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br>

<small>PARDONED</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was one of the most memorable fights that ever had
taken place on that field. For some reason no official
was about at the time to interrupt the battle, and the
monitors took a chance in order to see the sport. The big
boy fought like a young tiger, but Joshua’s enduring
qualities won for him in the end, and he beat his enemy
unmercifully before it was over, gouged at his eyes and
bit his thumb, and pounded him until he was a squalling,
sobbing, whimpering thing, pleading only that the fight
might end.</p>

<p>Beaver Clegg finally arrived and pulled Joshua off the
prostrate boy. He led him by the arm with quick steps
toward the Juvenile Department, where they faced each
other in the little office.</p>

<p>Clegg’s face had been red and mottled until then, but
now it became pallid as he slowly shook his head and
brushed nervously at his canted nose.</p>

<p>“At last, Joshua—at last,” he said morosely. “I thought
you could hold out.”</p>

<p>Joshua’s nose was bleeding, and one eye was almost
closed. His face was covered with dust, and the blood mixed
with it made him a disreputable-looking figure indeed. But
his lips were straight and untrembling, and his one good
eye looked steadily at his mentor.</p>

<p>“I have held out, Mr. Clegg,” he said. “I’ve put up
with a lot more than I’ve told you about. But I had to
do that. They were goin’ to parole me at the end o’ the
year.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>Clegg sat up straight, and his thick lips parted in surprise
and comprehension.</p>

<p>“Joshua Cole, do you mean that you deliberately started
a fight with Twenty-three forty-four in order to lower your
record for good behavior so that you would not be paroled?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir—that’s it,” Joshua replied. “I want to stay
here with you and study astronomy. That means more to
me than a T-and-H medal—and—and I don’t wanta go
home.”</p>

<p>For a long time Clegg’s colorless eyes looked at him
steadily, and his face was hard to read. Then the eyes
began to grow bluer until they became dark and purple,
and Clegg rose briskly.</p>

<p>“All right, Joshua,” he said. “I shall report you to
the superintendent, and then you will be taken to the
North Wing and punished. Do you know how you will be
punished, Joshua?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir—I’ve heard about it. I—I hadn’t forgotten
that.”</p>

<p>“Very well, Fifty-six thirty-five. That’s all for the
present.”</p>

<p>But as the boy turned away Clegg strode after him and
caught his arm at the door. “You—I’m sorry, Joshua,”
he faltered, and his eyes gleamed with tears. “But you
and I have made our own rules, and I guess there was no
other way. On the roof to-night, Joshua—if—if you are
able to stand. There’s a sixteen-day moon to-night, you
know.”</p>

<p>He laid a long arm tenderly over the boy’s shoulder, then
jerked it away and bustled back to his little desk.</p>

<p>Number Fifty-six thirty-five did not go to the roof that
night. He lay in bed unable to sleep because of the pain
that racked his body. Each agonizing twinge brought to
mind each stroke that had been struck with the terrible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
bamboo rod, and each stroke had felled him to the basement
floor, for he had been made to stoop to receive the
torture. Then the great brute of a man who was beating
him would wait for him to regain his feet and stoop again,
whereupon, with the rod in both hands, he would raise it
and bring it down with all his might. Each throb of pain
that now shook his shocked young body brought to mind
each grunt that had been forced from the man as he put
every ounce of his power behind the blows. The pain did
not ease because of Joshua’s remembrance that Twenty-three
forty-four had received the same number of stripes.</p>

<p>After this Joshua became a model inmate once more,
and he was treated with greater respect by his fellows.
That he could fight with such vigor and dogged determination
made them think twice before antagonizing him.</p>

<p>The year passed and another began, and once more
Joshua faced the board of directors and was presented
with a second T-and-H medal. But when they spoke of
parole Joshua told them he wanted to stay in the House
of Refuge. He was older now, more experienced, and Clegg
had told him that it was unnecessary for him to disobey the
rules in order to remain, if he would put the matter
squarely to the board. This he endeavored to do, stating
that he was interested in his studies and felt that he could
acquire a better education there than in public school.
The members of the board looked sidewise at one another;
they thought they understood why Joshua wanted to stay,
for they knew of his father and had no respect for him.
Joshua, advised by Clegg, made no mention of his studies
in astronomy.</p>

<p>The board dismissed him, promising to take the matter
into consideration. Perhaps they decided at last that
Joshua, of all the inmates of the institution, ought to be
allowed to remain until his twenty-first birthday if he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
wished to, because his grandfather had been the founder.
Whatever the reason, the boy was told that night by Beaver
Clegg that the board had ruled that he might stay. Furthermore,
he might remain in the Juvenile Department
as long as he saw fit. And Clegg had been authorized to
give him special instruction in higher branches than were
taught in his department. It was quite plain to Joshua
that Clegg had spoken highly of his progress as a student,
and that this was the result of his loyal friendship.</p>

<p>And now, with Joshua Cole deep in his studies and
steadily acquiring a practical working knowledge of astronomy
far beyond his years, it will be necessary for this
narrative to skip to a day when word reached the House
of Refuge that Joshua’s mother was dying. He was sent
to her deathbed immediately, but arrived too late.</p>

<p>During the funeral and afterward he was thrown in
contact with many of his relatives on her side of the house
whom he never before had met. Joshua gathered that they
had forgiven his mother now, and for them he harbored a
boy’s supreme contempt.</p>

<p>One old querulous gentleman in particular aroused his
boyish wrath, though the uncle—for so he was—did not
seem to realize it. He came from a far-off town in Virginia,
and was said to be very wealthy. This was Peter
Henry Florence, his mother’s oldest brother, who had been
given his father’s name.</p>

<p>Despite the boy’s dislike for him, the flabby-skinned old
man took a great interest in him. He had not known before
that Blanche’s eldest son had been placed in a reformatory,
and under his breath he heaped up imprecations on the
head of the father. He was for using his influence as the
son of old Peter D. Florence, the founder, in having Joshua
released. And when he found out that Joshua did not
want to leave, and had argued futilely against the boy’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
strange obstinacy, he purposed going to the House of Refuge
at once and demanding special privileges for his sister’s
son. All of which he seemed to forget entirely in a day
or two, for he went his choleric way back home and left no
word behind him.</p>

<p>So Joshua returned to the only man on earth that he
loved and admired and considered a friend, and wrapped
himself in his astronomy for three years more.</p>

<p>Then came a day when he stood, dry-eyed, beside a bed
on which lay the still form of Beaver Clegg. The master
had been found dead in his bed that morning—of heart
failure, the doctors said. It had long threatened him, and
the ugly man with a beautiful soul had been prepared, for
Joshua held in his hand a note to him which had been
penned several years before.</p>

<p>It told him that all along Clegg had tricked him into
believing that he—Clegg—was breaking the rules of the
institution when he led Joshua to the roof of nights and
schooled him in astronomy. Beaver Clegg’s department
had been virtually his to regulate as he saw fit, and if he
chose to take a boy from bed and teach him on the roof
at night it was the concern of no one but himself. Thus
had the old instructor inveigled Joshua into mastering
studies which were distasteful to him. Thus had he tried
him in the furnace to find out whether his love for science
was genuine, and one which was worth much sacrifice.</p>

<p>Tears threatened to deluge Joshua’s eyes when he read
the note, and the flood broke when he was told that Beaver
Clegg had willed to him his telescope and books and telescopic
photographs, and the clippings of over twenty painstaking
years.</p>

<p>And so it came about that Joshua Cole went before the
board again and asked for his rights in the matter of
parole. Whereupon the board decided to pardon him.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
And at the age of twenty, a quiet, serious, unworldly youth
with an ascetic face and kindly gray-blue eyes, he left the
House of Refuge, his home for over six years, with his telescope
over his shoulder.</p>

<p>But he did not go home. Lester had long since left the
old house on Grant Avenue and was working in a shoe
store, living alone in rented quarters. Only the father was
there, with the faithful Zida to minister to his fickle wants
when he was in from a trip. Joshua had heard that John
Cole was playing the races and drinking more than ever,
and he had no desire to see him. But he was penniless,
so he called on Lester for aid, which was refused. The
younger brother was earning barely enough to keep himself,
he said, and he looked upon Joshua with little favor,
referring often in his speech to his brother’s sojourn in
the House of Refuge and snickering the name of Tony.</p>

<p>There seemed no friend to turn to in his dilemma, and
Joshua, confined to his studies for so many years, imprisoned
and inexperienced in worldly matters, decided to
carry out the boyish plan that he had evolved when he and
Lester waited in the swampy lot for Slinky Dawson to come
along with the note that told of his disgrace at school.
Out there in the West somewhere was the girl that he never
had forgotten—Madge Mundy of the frizzly red-gold hair
and the Oriental-topaz eyes. He would find her.</p>

<p>So, with the exception of his telescope, he left in Lester’s
keeping all of the precious things bequeathed to him by
Beaver Clegg; and the night of the same day that he came
from the House of Refuge he sought the freight yards
under cover of darkness.</p>

<p>Three times, as he stole along looking for an empty boxcar
in a train that evidently was about to move out, he
imagined that somebody was following him. And now
he found his car and pushed his telescope through a side<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
door. He scrambled in after it, closed the door, and stood
silent in total darkness. Soon the train began to move,
but whether or not it was westward-bound the new recruit
in Vagabondia had no means of knowing. It would take
him away from Hathaway at all events, and for this he
longed, since the city of his birth had showed him little
but unkindness.</p>

<p>And on top of the car in which Joshua rode the figure of
a young man lay flat, awaiting the coming of a brakeman
over the running boards, whose lantern he saw swinging
up toward the locomotive. His name was Felix Wolfgang,
and he was of Norwegian extraction, but in the House of
Refuge his number had been Twenty-three forty-four.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br>

<small>AN OFFER OF PARTNERSHIP</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">HAD Joshua Cole been aware that the other tramp
who rode on top of the train had “squared things
with the brakeman,” he would not have been so
surprised at the long ride he made without being ordered
off by some train official. But he knew only that he was
not disturbed throughout the entire night, as he lay in
one corner on the hard floor, his head pillowed by an arm
that ached when he awoke from time to time.</p>

<p>Joshua had talked with many boys in the House of
Refuge who had been tramps. In fact, it seemed that the
greater portion of the inmates had been committed because
they had run away from home to seek adventures on the
road. The stories that they told had fascinated him, and
he had stored away much information as to how to conduct
oneself in Trampdom. Thus it came about that, while
having no practical knowledge of the ups and downs of the
vagrant life, he was theoretically fitted for his big adventure.</p>

<p>In the middle of the night the train rolled into Pittsburgh
and continued on, and still the traveler remained
undisturbed. When morning arrived, however, his first
knowledge of daylight came when the side door creaked
open suddenly and let in a flood of sunlight, while the train
was at a standstill.</p>

<p>“Here, you!” came a challenging voice. “Where you
goin’?”</p>

<p>Joshua rose from the floor of the car, tucked his telescope
and tripod under his arm, and went toward the door. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
head and shoulders of a man showed there, as he looked in
from the ground.</p>

<p>“Come on! Make it fast, Jack! Get outa here!”</p>

<p>Joshua’s blue-gray eyes studied the man as he stood back
well out of reach.</p>

<p>“Huh!” grunted the trainman. “Who’s road-kid are
you?”</p>

<p>“Nobody’s,” Joshua replied. He knew what a road-kid
was in the parlance of Trampdom—a boy who travels with
an older tramp for his “jocker,” for whom the boy begs
and steals, and is paid in brutal kicks and cuffs. They had
told him about “punks,” or “road-kids,” and “jockers”
in the House of Refuge.</p>

<p>“Well, get out and stay out!”</p>

<p>Joshua watched his chance, and, clutching his burden
firmly under an arm, ran to the door and jumped entirely
to the ground. The brakeman aimed a kick at him as he
struggled to rise from the stooping posture in which he had
alighted, but he avoided the man and darted up the tracks
toward a little town.</p>

<p>And in this undignified manner did Joshua Cole begin
his tour as a lecturing astronomer.</p>

<p>All day long he remained hidden in the willow-screened
bed of a river that paralleled the railroad tracks, hungry
and afraid to venture forth. He slept a little, making up
for his oft-interrupted slumbers of the night. His bones
ached like the bones of an old man, for the boxcar floor
had been even harder than the straw mattresses of the
House of Refuge. But when darkness came he sallied out
and sought the main street of the village, where men lazed
in the moonlight under wooden awnings, and girls and
women, garbed in flimsy lawns, paraded back and forth,
with arms encircling waists, through a flower-perfumed
night in early summer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>At the principal corner the hungry waif set up his tripod,
adjusted his telescope, and trained it on the rising moon.
Then his courage, cowed by hunger, bade fair to desert him,
and to make him forget the speech that he had been rehearsing
all day. But he girded up his loins, and in a squeaky,
stage-frightened voice addressed a number of loafers who
had been viewing his operations in silent wonder.</p>

<p>“Ladies and gentlemen,” he quavered, “to-night the
mu—moon is in the last quarter, and the black, pointed
shadows of the towering peaks of the lunar Alps are—are
very clear. To-night you can see plainly the longest mountain
range on the moon. This great range is four hundred
and sixty miles in length, and is called the Apennines.
Three thousand sharp peaks in this range rise abruptly from
the <i>Mare Imbrum</i> to a height of from twelve thousand to
twenty thousand feet. These are plainly visible to-night
through this telescope that I have here. You may look at
them for ten cents apiece, and each observer will be allowed
three minutes at the telescope. While you look I shall explain
the various moon objects that are of interest to you.
Now, who—who’ll be the first?”</p>

<p>He looked, as he stood there timidly regarding them, like
some young disciple of the eternal stars, sent on earth to
scatter the fogs of prejudice and superstition. The pale
light of the moon fell softly on his lean, ascetic features
and threw them in sharp relief. His coal-black hair accentuated
the steel-cut lines in the picture of his face. Even
in the half-light those earnest, tolerant, gray-blue eyes
seemed to plead; and at last a man, whispering to his neighbor,
screwed himself sidewise and reached a hand into his
trousers pocket.</p>

<p>“Le’s see what the kid’s got up his sleeve,” he suggested,
and walked toward Joshua with his dime.</p>

<p>Being instructed, he placed his eye to the eye-piece.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
There followed a moment or two of silence, and then
Joshua’s first patron breathed a deep sigh and fervently
muttered:</p>

<p>“Gysh A’mighty!”</p>

<p>Wonders of which he had never dreamed suddenly were
revealed to him. His phlegmatic soul had been whisked
away from his game of horseshoes of the afternoon, his
heavy supper of fried pork and gravy and baking-powder
biscuits, and was borne up, up, up, as light as the perfume
of the flowering night, to a mystic region that his imagination
never could have pictured.</p>

<p>“Gysh!” he breathed again.</p>

<p>“Whatcha see, Henry?”—from the shadows under the
awning where the man had rested.</p>

<p>“Huh!”</p>

<p>“See anythin’ o’ the cow that Bud Shamleffer lost last
week up there?”</p>

<p>“H’m-m!”</p>

<p>And now Joshua, encouraged by the awe in the man’s
voice, began speaking. He told in his soft tones of wondrous
plains and craters and sea bottoms, and instructed
his pupil where to look for them. The other men left the
whittled bench and stood around, silent, listening intently
to every word. Women stopped in their parade, and halted
at the edge of the little throng. Some held youngsters by
the hand. Girls giggled at they knew not what.</p>

<p>“Hush, Albert!” came a shrill voice. “Listen to what
the young man is saying, can’t you? Yes, it’s a spyglass,
and Mr. Haddon is looking at the moon. How much does
it cost to look, Pa?... Yes, if you’ll be good and keep
still Pa’ll let you look through it. Won’t you, Pa? Albert
Washburn, if you don’t keep still Pa’ll—”</p>

<p>“The awe-inspiring Sea of Serenity embraces an area of
one hundred and twenty-five thousand miles. It is almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
entirely surrounded by mountains. The oddly twisted
range seen running for—”</p>

<p>“Albert Washburn, will you hush?”</p>

<p>“—hundreds of miles along its western floor suggests
the action of water, as does also the wrinkled plain of <i>Mare
Tranquilitatis</i>. Note how marvelously interspersed are the
light and dark regions—”</p>

<p>“C’mon away, Haddon, an’ give somebody else a look.
Yer three minutes is up long time ago!”</p>

<p>So for more than an hour and a half the telescope followed
the moon across the heavens, while the villagers found
dimes and braces of nickels with which to buy a glimpse of
the wonder thereof. Albert had had his yelled-for observation
and was carried away squalling for more, unquieted by
dire threats of what would happen to him when he reached
home. But finally interest waned, and then the young
astronomer folded his tripod and lashed it to the telescope,
and sought a restaurant on the point of closing. In his
pocket were sixteen dimes and six nickels, the first money
that he had earned since he taught roller-skating back in
Hathaway. And Beaver Clegg had called Science an indifferent
paymaster!</p>

<p>Then a man slipped in after Joshua and took the stool
beside him at the counter. He gave his order in a low
mumble and sat with bowed head awaiting its coming.
Joshua glanced at him and gave a start. Beaver Clegg had
been ugly of face, but the great heart of him had glorified
that ugliness. The man who sat at Joshua’s side was a
living horror.</p>

<p>He wore disreputable clothes, topped by a black Stetson
hat with a round, narrow brim. Dust and sweat had made
a gray ring about the hat where the brim and crown were
joined. There was a long livid scar on his right cheek,
slick and red and hairless. But about it stood a week’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
growth of stubble, which made the mark more hideous.
The ugly mouth, twisted grotesquely to one side, was nothing
short of repulsive, and as the dark little eyes looked up
ratlike into Joshua’s the boy almost shivered.</p>

<p>“Say, Jack,” ventured the pitted lips, “dat was a nifty
little performance youse put on for de hicks dis evenin’.
W’ere’d youse get next to de look-see?”</p>

<p>Joshua was obliged to request an interpretation.</p>

<p>“De telescope—w’ere d’youse glom it?”</p>

<p>“Why,” replied Joshua, “it was given to me by my instructor
in—in school.”</p>

<p>“She’s one nifty little money-getter,” vouchsafed the
other. “I was lampin’ youse from acrost de drag. How
much d’youse glom, Jack?”</p>

<p>Joshua knew now that he was speaking with a tramp.
He realized, too, that here was an old-timer, one of the
breed known in Trampdom as John Yeggs. To be called
Jack bespoke all this, and Joshua became wary at once.</p>

<p>“I took in nearly two dollars,” he made reply to the
direct question.</p>

<p>“Dat’s goin’ some! Cheese, I didn’t make four bits wid
de skeletons dis afternoon! But dey’re woiked to de’t’
anyway dese days.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you mean,” said Joshua.</p>

<p>“De skeletons? Say, ain’t youse never seen a guy woik
de skeletons on de hicks? Dere’s two of ’em, youse savvy,
and youse set on a street corner an’ make ’em dance on a
black clot’ by pullin’ a black t’read. De hicks usta fall fer
dem, but not so much lately. Dat’s me graft, Jack—one
of ’em. I got sever’l good lines. But dat telescope racket
looks good to me. Say, youse’re only a kid an’ youse need
a jocker. Youse’re on de road, I know, ’cause I see youse
take a sneak from a boxcar to-day and hide in de jungles.
Now, lissen, kid—youse’re new on de road an’ don’t savvy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
wot’s wot. I do—I’m an ol’-timer meself. I c’n put youse

telescope. Youse c’n run ’er an’ make de spiel, an’ I’ll
mooch ’round and chase de hicks to youse. We’ll make it
all over de country. Dat’s wot youse want, kid—youse

Youse’ll be me road-kid, an’ I’ll perteck youse from a lotta

<p class="drop-cap">IN the vernacular of the road the John Yegg was trying
to snare Joshua, and Joshua knew it. Still, he had
little fear of the man. He was perhaps too inexperienced
to fear anybody who did not threaten to thrust his
head into a bathtub filled with water. He knew himself to
be a novice at tramping over the country. Also he was
lonesome, for he had had friends of a sort in the House
of Refuge. He studied the man who termed himself The
Whimperer, and wondered if, despite the fellow’s repulsiveness,
it might not be well to consider his proposal.
The tramp could help him over the rough places in his
journey westward. It might even be possible that he would
be an asset when it came to inducing people to look through
the telescope at ten cents a look, for Joshua was not a
forward young man and knew that he would find difficulty
in selling his knowledge to the public. Then, could he
not contrive to steal away and leave The Whimperer whenever
the association became irksome? He did not like the
man’s face. But, then, he had not liked the face of Beaver
Clegg when first he saw it; and what a change that ugly
man had wrought in his life! Joshua could read the stars,
but he had not the experience in life to read the faces of
his fellowmen. It was the fact that The Whimperer might
help him to get out West, above everything else, that caused
him to consider this strange offer of partnership.</p>

<p>For Joshua was determinedly bound for the West.
Locked up for so long in the House of Refuge, he had met<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
no girls at all, and the picture of Madge Mundy was still
fresh in his memory. She was the last girl that he had met
before his commitment, the girl who had aroused in him
the first whisperings of the male’s desire for the society of
the opposite sex. He still thought of Madge as he had seen
her last, Oriental-topaz eyes aglow, bronze hair streaming
down her youthful shoulders. And, boy though he yet was,
he was seriously intent on seeking her, out there somewhere
in the West. Perhaps the man called The Whimperer could
help him find her.</p>

<p>Their orders were set before them, and the tramp talked
as he ate greedily. He told of adventures on the road,
covering a period of many years of vagabondage. His
speech was quaint and in great part unintelligible to
Joshua, but the boy listened despite secret warnings that
came again and again.</p>

<p>“Dere’s a lotta t’ings a plug c’n folly if he’s wise,”
observed The Whimperer. “Don’t worry—youse’n’ me’ll
always get our scoffin’s. And if de telescope racket fails
and de woist comes to de woist I c’n slip whimpermeter to
de Ezras and get us lumps.”</p>

<p>“I don’t always understand you,” said Joshua. “What’s
a lump?”</p>

<p>“A lump,” explained The Whimperer, inwardly gloating
over the boy’s innocence, “is wot a kin’ lady slips youse
w’en youse batter de back door. If she invites youse in
and lets youse t’row yer feet unner de table, it’s a set-down.
If she slips youse a lunch in a poiper bag, it’s a
lump. See? Get me, Jack?”</p>

<p>“And what is whimpermeter?”</p>

<p>“Dat’s a woid dat I coined meself,” proudly proclaimed
the John Yegg. “I’m kinda educated, youse see, Jack.
Dat is, w’ile I ain’t got any schoolin’, I see t’ings. Get
me? I use me nut, and I read quite a lot. Wot I call<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
whimpermeter is a line o’ patter dat I hand out w’en I’m
moochin’ fer de eats. I c’n twist up me face till it looks
like I’m geed-up fer good. See dis here scar?” He indicated
the smooth, red mark on his cheek. “Dat’s wot
youse’d call an artificial scar, Jack. I had dat boined dere
wid acid, an’ I had ’er run down into de corner o’ me mout’
apoipus. Den w’en I twist me mout’ towards it—like dis—an’
close de eye on dat side—like dis—dey all kinda run
togedder, an’ me face looks like I been t’rough some terrible
experience. Hey? Get me?”</p>

<p>Joshua did get him, for his face, twisted as it was, looked
hideous.</p>

<p>“Den,” The Whimperer continued, “I was an acerbat in
a little circus onct, until de booze got me. An’ I c’n t’row
me arms outa joint an’ make it look like I’m all crippled
up. Jes’ watch!”</p>

<p>On the stool, he twisted himself sidewise, and there came
a succession of bony clicks along his left arm. Through his
coatsleeve, even, Joshua could see the knots where bones
had jumped their sockets, and his fingers, every one out
of joint, were monstrously contorted. The entire arm
looked as if it had been rendered useless in grinding
machinery.</p>

<p>“Dat wing is me livin’, Jack,” he proudly observed.
“How ’bout it? Didn’t I look like I needed some kin’
lady’s help? Den I play like I’m dumb, too—see?—an’ I
twist meself up like dat and point to me mout’ an’ shake
me head, an’ slip ’em one o’ dese here pomes dat I wrote
meself an’ had printed in Chicago.”</p>

<p>He fished in an inside pocket of his greasy coat and produced
a dirty card, which he proudly handed to his prospective
neophyte.</p>

<p>“Read dat,” he offered.</p>

<p>And Joshua read:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>Joshua’s lips were twitching over the unconscious humor
of this weird verse, but he straightened them when he
noted that the author’s keen little eyes were watching
him defiantly.</p>

<p>“Ain’t dat a nifty sob-squeezer, Jack?” he wanted to
know.</p>

<p>“It’s very good,” Joshua lied placidly.</p>

<p>“It gets de coin,” remarked The Whimperer, recovering
the card. “Dat’s wot I call whimpermeter. I make up
dem voises meself, an’ sometimes I peddle ’em to udder
stiffs dat ain’t got de savvy an’ wot I calls de capacity to
compose ’em fer demselves. Dat’s w’y dey call me De
Whimperer—whimperin’ is me graft. See? And I make
more money dan any stiff on de road, I’ll bet. But if
youse’re t’rough scoffin’, le’s get outa here an’ beat it
down to de jungles. We’ll build a fire an’ wait fer de
eleven-o’clock t’rough freight, bound west. She stops here
fer woter. Rap on a dish fer de lady to come out o’ de
kitchen—and youse pay fer me, too. Wot d’ye say, Jack?
I’m a little short dis evenin’, but I’ll slip youse it to-morrow.”</p>

<p>This was more than Joshua had bargained for, but when
the proprietress came at his signal he meekly paid for his
own and the John Yegg’s meal. Then, scarce knowing why
he did it, he shouldered his telescope and followed the tramp
out into the soft summer night, steeped in the perfume of
roses and serenaded by choirs of frogs.</p>

<p>The Whimperer shuffled along toward the river at the
side of Joshua. Joshua really had no place to go unless
he rented a room in the town’s one hotel, and if he could
catch a train westward-bound at eleven o’clock that night
he preferred to do so. He therefore accompanied the tramp,
curious to learn more of the strange life into which he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
ventured as mysteriously as man is born upon the earth,
willy nilly.</p>

<p>In the river bottom, some distance from the village, The
Whimperer built a fire—after Joshua had collected twigs
and driftwood.</p>

<p>“It ain’t cold,” said the tramp, “but a fire’s nice.
Now youse lay down an’ get a little sleep, an’ I’ll wake
youse up w’en de freight is ramblin’ in. Go on—do wot
I tell youse. If youse’re gonta be me kid, youse’ve gotta
min’ me.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br>

<small>THE PARTNERSHIP DISSOLVED</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">JOSHUA, worn out from loss of sleep the night before,
curled up beside the fire on the ground. He resented
The Whimperer’s matter-of-fact assumption of jockership
over him, but he was too tired to protest. If the
John Yegg was willing to stay awake and watch for the
coming of the freight Joshua was content, for the present,
to allow him to general his Western flight.</p>

<p>He fell asleep almost immediately. Then for a long time
the strange man who had forced his companionship upon
the boy sat watching him with his inscrutable eyes. Finally,
deciding that his charge actually was asleep, he rose softly
and shuffled off through the willows into the night.</p>

<p>He fell into a sandy path and followed it for some distance.
Then he halted, and a soft whistle, repeated several
times, came from his pitted lips.</p>

<p>Presently there was an answer, and before long a
shadow fell across an open space in the trees, and the
guarded question came:</p>

<p>“Is dat youse, Whimp?”</p>

<p>“Yeah,” replied The Whimperer. “Don’t make no
noise. He’s sleepin’.”</p>

<p>Felix Wolfgang, the youth who now slipped to the side
of the old tramp, was the name of the boy known to Joshua
Cole in the House of Refuge as Number Twenty-three
forty-four. Wolfgang had reached his twenty-first birthday
while Joshua was still studying astronomy under
Beaver Clegg, and had been released. He was of Norwegian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
descent, and had gone to the institution from the slums of
Joshua’s birthplace.</p>

<p>He had proved one of the most incorrigible inmates of
the school, and had been released only because it was not
allowed to keep a boy beyond the age of maturity. Felix
had returned to his old haunts, had become a gang leader,
and had hoboed all over the United States before Joshua
came out. Many times he had been arrested, and once the
penitentiary had threatened to take him within its gray
walls.</p>

<p>He was tall and lean, with sandy hair, and as freckled
as a painter’s ladder. His expression of face was that of
the swaggering gangster, cruel and insolent. He used the
argot of gangs and thieves and tramps, and was all in all
a tough young rascal on the eve of becoming a conscienceless
criminal.</p>

<p>“Well, wot’s doin’?” he asked The Whimperer in a
husky whisper. This huskiness of voice was habitually assumed
for effect, but now it was huskier still for the sake
of secrecy.</p>

<p>“Well, I pretty near snared um,” was The Whimperer’s
reply. “Anyway, I got um in camp in de jungles, an’ he’s
poundin’ his ear. I’ll get um away on de t’rough freight
to-night, an’ den I guess I c’n swing um. But it’ll cost
some jack, ol’-timer. I’ll hafta be punglin’ up to de shacks
so’s we c’n ride safe in boxcars. I gotta do dat to keep
from gettin’ separated from um. Youse better come acrost
wid sumpin, hadn’t youse?”</p>

<p>“How much d’youse want?” asked Wolfgang, not seeming
to relish the suggestion.</p>

<p>“Slip me ten bones.”</p>

<p>“I’ll give youse five.”</p>

<p>“Nuttin’ doin’! Five won’t put us—”</p>

<p>“Here—take it and shut up! Dere’s more w’ere dis come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
from, an’ youse’ll get it w’en youse need it. I know youse,
Whimp—if youse get yer glommers on too much coin
youse’ll get lit an’ let de kid slip away. Five’s enough f’r
now.”</p>

<p>Grumblingly the John Yegg accepted the tendered bill
and hid it in his pocket. “Well, wot’s to do?”</p>

<p>“Jes’ stick to um, dat’s all youse’ve gotta do.”</p>

<p>“But wot’s it all about, Slim? Youse only tol’ me dat
youse follied dis plug from Hathaway, lookin’ fer some experienced
tramp to put on his trail. Well, youse was lucky
in findin’ one, Jack, an’ I’ll do pretty near anyt’ing to get
me gloms on a piece o’ kale. But wot do I do, an’ w’y do
I do it?”</p>

<p>“Youse don’ need to know any more dan I already tol’
youse,” husked Wolfgang. “Youse do wot I say an’ I’ll
pay your expenses, an’ w’en de proper time comes I’ll slip
youse de biggest piece o’ jack youse ever had yer mitts on.
Ain’t dat enough?”</p>

<p>“But, Slim—”</p>

<p>“Dat’s all from me. Take it or leave it.”</p>

<p>“But w’ere’ll youse be w’en it comes time to hand me
dis big money?”</p>

<p>“I’m travelin’ right along wid youse, ol’-timer. Youse
won’t have no trouble findin’ me w’en de time comes. Now
go on back to de fire, an’ be ready to make dat freight w’en
she rambles in. I’ll ketch ’er too—don’t worry about me.
Get de kid in a boxcar, an’ I’ll ride outside an’ be ready
to square de shack if it looks like he’s gonta ditch youse
guys. An’ if youse get ditched an’ get another train, keep
headin’ West. Dat’s all—leave de rest to me.”</p>

<p>“I don’t like it,” said The Whimperer.</p>

<p>“But youse’re gonta do it jes’ de same, ain’t youse?”
sneered Wolfgang, and went his way through the sand of
the river bottom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>Mumbling to himself, The Whimperer returned to the
fire to find Joshua still peacefully sleeping. There he sat
himself down and fell to dreaming, his piggish black eyes
fixed unseeingly on the blaze.</p>

<p>“Dere’s wot youse might call a dark plot on foot,” he
muttered softly. “Dat Slim Wolfgang’s a bad acter, fer
a kid, an’ I’m wonderin’—jes’ wonderin’. Who is dis here
telescope guy, anyway? Dat’s wot I’m wonderin’.”</p>

<p>He continued his wondering for an hour or more, half
dozing at times, but too old a hand on the road to allow
himself full sleep when a train that he wished to catch was
nearly due. And when there came to his half-hearing ears
the distant long shriek of a locomotive he was instantly
alert and bending over Joshua.</p>

<p>“C’mon, kid!” he warned, shaking the boy awake.
“Come out of it an’ get yer look-see. She’s ramblin’
to us.”</p>

<p>Through the night Joshua stumbled along after him, his
telescope, as inseparable as Christian’s burden, over his
shoulder. They left the river bottom and crawled through
a fence. They climbed the fill of the railroad grade, and
the big bright eye of the coming locomotive gleamed at them
from up the track, showering the rails at their feet with
brilliancy.</p>

<p>“Dat’s her, all right,” avowed The Whimperer. “She’ll
stop to take woter at dis boig, an’ de tank’s on de udder
side o’ de deepo. Dat’ll bring de middle o’ de train somew’eres
about here, an’ we c’n glom her easy. Le’s get down
de fill an’ lay hid in de grass till we see wot’s doin’.”</p>

<p>The train acted according to the tramp’s wishes, and
soon was at a standstill, with a string of dark boxcars looming
above the expectant watchers. The Whimperer raised
himself lizard-like from their hiding place and looked
toward the rear end and the head end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>“Jake,” he presently announced. “Everyt’ing’s clear.
C’mon!”</p>

<p>They walked along beside the train, The Whimperer investigating
every car for an unsealed door, which indicated
an empty. In the course of time he found one, cautiously
slid it open, and, after carefully looking up and down the
track, scrambled in and reached down a hand to his companion.
When both were aboard the veteran closed the
door as softly as possible, and then they stood in silence
and awaited the dictates of chance.</p>

<p>No “shack” came to rout them out, and before long the
short <i>toot-toot</i> of the locomotive whistle announced that the
train was “out of town,” and then the wheels began to
creak.</p>

<p>“Not bad,” The Whimperer praised himself, and sat
down on the floor, with his ever-weary back against one of
the boxcar’s walls. “Hit de hay, kid,” he invited.
“Dere’ll be lots o’ time to sleep if youse travel wid De
Whimperer fer yer jocker. He’s de plug dat’ll put youse
t’rough. No foolin’!”</p>

<p>They made a big jump that night, and morning found
them well into the misnamed Middle West. They were
routed out by an irate brakeman about ten o’clock, to discover
that they were in a fair-sized town and to be chased
from railroad property by one of the company’s detectives.
The Whimperer thought the town too large for a scientific
lecture, and advised walking to a near-by village.</p>

<p>It was only three miles distant, and they reached it well
before noon. Often, as they walked, The Whimperer looked
back along the track at a figure following them, then
watched his companion to see if he had been observed.
When they reached the village The Whimperer protested
against a restaurant, and they bought meat and vegetables
and “cooked up” in the jungles. Here they rested until<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
night, then went into the town, where Joshua once more
set up his telescope and invited the populace to view the
moon. The Whimperer stood by, listening to the lecture,
but seeming to realize that anything he could contribute
to the proceedings might result in failure because of his
suspicious looks.</p>

<p>Joshua’s earnings were frugal that night, and The Whimperer
growled his disapproval, as a good jocker should, over
his road-kid’s failure to make good. In the middle of the
night they caught another freight, were thrown off, caught
a second, and were far from their starting point when
morning came.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>To follow in detail the fortunes of the boy who later
became Cole of Spyglass Mountain doubtless would make
interesting reading; but that is not the purpose of this
narrative. To tell how he was led westward like a dancing
monkey on a chain by that errant vagabond, The Whimperer,
would be to chronicle a series of strange adventures,
the like of which never took place before in Trampdom.
Joshua saw all the degradation of tramp life, met famous
hobos and infamous hobos; slept in sand-houses, Salvation
Army rooming houses, in coal bunkers, stretched out along
the backs of several sheep bleating in a stock car, in cars
of grain, beneath piles of lumber, and in many a well-known
“jungle” camp. He saw all of the inner workings
of the itinerant life which is so peculiarly an American institution,
worked at many things, fought many battles—some
won, some lost. Reduced to bitter hunger countless
times, he almost lost his courage and began to believe himself
nothing but a pawn of Fate. There is a strange lure
about the life of the tramp that pleads with the most circumspect
to renounce the ways of honest men and live the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
life of shiftlessness and freedom, and Joshua Cole did not
escape it.</p>

<p>Time and again, in the beginning, he tried to lose himself
from The Whimperer, but failed repeatedly. He did not
know that, when he contrived to steal away and catch a
train alone, a shadow followed him and watched his movements,
then wired his whereabouts to his jocker, who overtook
him by paying his fare on a first-class train. When
the tramp caught up with him, however, he dared not resort
to the common practice among men of this type of beating
his road-kid. It was doubtful if the stiff old youth-drained
yegg could have handled the boy just budding into manhood,
so he resorted to wheedling pleas and worked on
Joshua’s sympathy, at which The Whimperer was an adept.</p>

<p>They had been on the road together nearly a year, and
the misfortunes of tramp life had whipped them here and
there, north and south and east and west, which left Joshua
far from the goal he sought, before The Whimperer learned
of the value of the telescope. Joshua’s many efforts to
evade the yegg had in great measure brought about this
zigzag course; for his jocker knew that he was headed
west, so Joshua had ridden north- and south-bound trains
in the effort to deceive him. Now they were in Kansas,
after having crossed that state several times, and settled
in a “jungle” camp for the night.</p>

<p>The Whimperer lolled on one side of the campfire, and
on the other side sat Joshua, in a begged suit of clothes
much too large for him, looking up at his friends, the stars,
and vaguely wondering what the future held in store for
him.</p>

<p>“Rig up de ole look-see,” suggested The Whimperer,
“an’ give us a slant at de eternal heavens.”</p>

<p>To the weird old panhandler the telescope was ever a
thing to be wondered at, but, strange to say, he had talked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
very little with Joshua about it. In his twisted mind was
the realization that this young man lived in a world apart
from his, and he was not a little awed by Joshua’s knowledge.
But to-night the stars were soft and radiant, and
their spell fell upon the man. Then as Joshua began adjusting
the refractor on its tripod, the yeggman asked:</p>

<p>“Say, wot does one o’ dem t’ings cost, kid?”</p>

<p>“This one,” said Joshua, “is worth five hundred
dollars.”</p>

<p>The glory faded out of the stars. With a bound the
tramp was on his feet. “Wot!” he gasped.</p>

<p>“Five hundred dollars,” Joshua repeated.</p>

<p>The Whimperer drew in a long breath and allowed the
wind to burst from his lungs. “Kid,” he asked in a
trembling tone, “d’ye mean to slip it to me dat youse’n’me’s
been cold an’ hungry an’ wet an’ wid no place to flop a
million times, w’ile youse was packin’ five hundred bones
over yer shoulder?”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t pack it,” Joshua placidly reminded him.</p>

<p>“W’y, dat’s simply—simply—” Words failed the awestruck
Whimperer. “Dat’s simply scand’lous!” he barked
out finally. “Kid, we coulda peddled dat t’ing, an’— Well,
wot couldn’t we ’a’ done!”</p>

<p>“Peddled this refractor!”</p>

<p>“Sure peddle ’er, Jack. W’y youse’re a bigger fool dan
I t’o’t youse was. Gawd A’mighty, kid! T’ink of it!”</p>

<p>A low laugh came from Joshua’s lips. “Forget that,”
he said. “Nothing could make me part with my telescope.
Here it is. Come on.”</p>

<p>“I don’t wanta look now, kid,” said The Whimperer.
“I—I kinda lost me appetite fer de udder universes. Five
hundred smackers! Gawd A’mighty!”</p>

<p>For the remainder of that night, while they waited for
a train, The Whimperer sat lost in thought. They caught<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
a freight bound west at midnight, and next morning Joshua
was rudely shaken to a realization of the stern realities of
life by a dark-browed brakeman.</p>

<p>He sprang erect, ready to defend himself against this
common enemy of tramps, and found that he had no companion
to aid him. At some stop during the night while
Joshua slept The Whimperer had left the train—and the
telescope had gone with him.</p>

<small>MAN AND THE SLUG</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MAN is a human chameleon. Environment plays
strange pranks with what he had imagined was
the settled order of his life. He owes his mental
development to his gregariousness. Aeons ago when the
hairy cavemen formed clans the first step was taken toward
organized society as we know it to-day.</p>

<p>Transport a man of the street from Broadway and set
him down among the Eskimos, and not many years will
have elapsed before he will be thinking and fighting and
loving and longing as do the brown little people of the
North. His ego will clamor for recognition. He cannot
endure social ostracism. So as the Eskimos cannot interest
themselves in his Broadway, cannot think his Broadway,
cannot see his Broadway, the Broadway within him
flickers out so that his soul-hunger for companionship may
be appeased. You may set him back on Broadway after
a lapse of years and in a day none will know that he has
ever left it; but so long as he lives in the Frozen North
so long will he be an Eskimo. There will of course be
memories and unvoiced regrets to torture him through recurring
moods of reminiscence, but these will be brief and
will occur of lonely nights. Throughout the days he will
be an Eskimo. And sometimes he will not care to return
to Broadway. Men even deliberately return to penitentiaries
where they have spent great portions of their lives.</p>

<p>Man is a human chameleon; it is beyond dispute. His
soul craves intercourse with his fellows and without it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
shrivels to a rattling pod. And if he be associated day by
day with only tramps he will either become a tramp or a
morbid Pariah—and from the last he shrinks in horror.</p>

<p>This was taking place in the heart of Joshua Cole. By
gradual degrees he was growing to think and see and look
at life through the eyes of the nomad men about him.
Spring was manifest. There seemed to be a subtle incense
in the air that drugged him and contorted his views. He
was living close to Mother Earth. Creature comforts were
all that he craved. There was a sort of strange fascination
about living from hand to mouth. The ingenuity required
to live on nothing—the resourcefulness demanded—made
strong appeal to some primitive satisfaction within him.
He took a sort of pride in the comfort of a full belly when
it was the result of luck or primitive cunning. To get
something for nothing seems always to be the ambition of
the race, no matter how warningly reason may rebel. To
cover a hundred miles of country without paying a cent for
transportation gave him the same amount of pride or satisfaction
or gloating. It all made appeal to his sense of individuality.
He was parasitically living and moving and
having his being as does some wild thing in the woods—some
flower of the fields. Trifling achievements caused his mentality
to strut. He was as contented over discovering an
unexpected warm place to creep into out of the rain as a
merchant is in making an unexpectedly large sale of goods
at the close of the day’s business. If he outwitted a train
crew and made a longer jump than he had imagined possible,
his vanity was tickled, even as might be tickled the
vanity of a lawyer who has engineered a coup in court and
brought about the admiration of the jury and his client,
and the discomfiture of opposing counsel. He rejoiced as
the caveman rejoiced over insignificant developments; but
to him and the caveman they were not insignificant. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
meant food and warmth and shelter. On Broadway similar
developments might mean more expensive apartments, a
new sedan, a trip to Europe, a diamond tiara.</p>

<p>Subtle Spring had borne on her soft wings the pollen
of a strange philosophy. After all, what was life but the
constant and inherent struggle to live? What mattered it
how one lived?—or where? Was not coffee as delectable
boiled in a blackened can over a campfire as in a silver-mounted
electric percolator? Why did man wear clothes?
To keep his body warm, or to turn his acquaintances green
with envy? Was there more warmth and comfort in a
hundred-dollar custom-made creation than in the whole
though unpresentable suit that clothed Joshua Cole? Was
his old home in Hathaway any warmer than a Southern
Pacific sand-house? Did millionaires travel faster in
their private cars than he could travel on top of one of
them?</p>

<p>After all, what was the use in being anything but a
vagabond? What men called progress brought nothing but
aches and pains and shortened lives. Civilization was all
pretense and cosmetics. Months had passed since the theft
of the telescope, and Joshua, racing wildly here and there,
risking his life a dozen times to catch fast trains, had
failed to find The Whimperer. He laughed bitterly now as
he sat in his camp alone, in Southern Colorado.</p>

<p>For five days he had eaten nothing, and was no longer
hungry. Starvation brings weird imaginings to the mind
of man. Strange fancies come to him—dreams that are
like the dreams of addicts to some potent narcotic. He
saw Civilization in all its pretense, in all of its hollow
shams, in all of its aimless flounderings toward nothing.
Science—bah! What could he ever hope to learn of science?
Almost from birth he had been the victim of a cruel Fate.
Well, he was through—absolutely through! Fate had ordained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
that he be a tramp. Why kick against the pricks?
He would be a tramp.</p>

<p>Then suddenly he saw something on the ground that
whisked his mind back over the years to another day in
spring, when he and his brother Lester and two other boys
had watched a slug lower itself from a chip by a string
of mucus. And what he saw was another slug, of the same
species, <i>Limax Campestris</i>, blind, wriggling helplessly
along, bound nowhere.</p>

<p>Man was like this poor creature, condemned to a short
space of endless wriggling about merely because life was
in it.</p>

<p>Man the slug! A million million years from now this
slug might have a brain and be trying to telegraph to
Mars! Wouldn’t he look odd in a limousine, in which he
would proudly ride until rheumatism confined him to his
chair at the age of fifty and indigestion made him growl
at his slug attendant. Poor thing! God help him then.
Better were it had he remained a slug wriggling along
through slime, with man’s foot forever threatening to end
his stupid life!</p>

<p>Then Joshua saw another one—a snail with a wonderful
shell upon his back. He blinked his gray-blue eyes and
smiled. Why, here was progress—a closed car, by George!
His speed was no greater—it required as long for him to
travel from leaf to leaf as it did his more unfortunate
brother; but surely the shell spelled progress.</p>

<p>Long and tremulously he laughed at his whimsicality.
Was he going crazy? No, no! He was right, eternally
right. In the end, what would it matter if he became a
great astronomer and won fame and favor? Fame was a
hollow thing. Men would forget him two days after he had
died. Millions could not keep him any warmer than he had
been last night in the sand-house. He could eat only so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
much, and after he had eaten what recked it whether he
had partaken of caviar on toast or cornbread? Did he wish
to travel? Before him stretched lines of steel. In ports
lay vessels riding at anchor, awaiting his coming as a
stoker or a roustabout or a stowaway. Did he crave knowledge,
news, entertainment? Great libraries were open to
him in every consequential town. Did he need new clothes?
There were institutions galore to supply them for a little
trifling toil. Did he crave friendship? His world was
filled with men who would not hold themselves aloof were
he to make advances.</p>

<p>Then why not become a tramp? Why not be original—unique?
Save Beaver Clegg, among all the men and women
he had known there was not one original mind—not one
fearless heart—not one soul that was not clutched and
clamped by the prosaic, by the ever-haunting fear that its
possessor was not thinking and acting and living just as
other men and women were. Why, they actually abhorred
the original! Deliberately they stultified such original
thoughts as now and then beseechingly presented themselves.
Sheep, all of them—bleating, crowding sheep, shouldering
one another aside in an effort to gain the protection
of the middle of the flock, where no one might single them
out and accuse them of being anything but sheep! Could
he, Joshua Cole, a man now, hope to become the bellwether
of this wriggling, woolly mass? No, because he would not
stoop to setting a pace that their newspaper, moving-picture
minds would follow. Pitiable worms slathering in the
slime of up-to-dateness! Afraid of their own minds,
afraid of their neighbors’ minds, afraid of life itself!</p>

<p>He would become a tramp—a unique tramp—king of the
tramps! At least he would be an object of wonder, though
an outcast. Better a kingpin among tramps than a huddling
lamb in a flock of trembling sheep, all just like him!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>Joshua maneuvered a stick until the slug was upon it,
and as on that other spring day repeated the experiment
that had been the actual beginning of his vagabondage.</p>

<p>“How now, old-timer?” he croakingly chuckled.
“You’re on an island of wood, and the earth is twenty
times your length below you. What will you do? You’ve
reached a momentous period in your career. Blind, brainless,
inefficient, pitiably helpless, yet Nature has provided
you with the means of overcoming a catastrophe like this.
And does that mean that there is hope for the race of
man?”</p>

<p>Then as the pitiable creature completed its travels over
the stick and began lowering itself to the ground, Joshua
put down the stick and burst into a fit of nervous weeping,
the result of strain and hunger.</p>

<p>Like a repentant blasphemer Joshua Cole threw himself
on the grass, sobbing piteously.</p>

<p>“O God!” he prayed passionately, “at last I have learned
life’s greatest lesson! Mankind is in the hollow of Thy
hand. Not a sparrow falls unheeded. Not a worm is cloven
in vain. Somewhere there is a goal worth striving for, and
toward it man is always floundering. In him lies the means
of his own salvation. Some day in the unseen future he
will learn his own humanity; for within him Thou hast
planted the power to return to the image of God in which
he was created. I will keep on traveling West—and—and
find another telescope—and Madge.”</p>

<p>Joshua Cole had fought his first great battle—and won.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br>

<small>OUT WEST</small></h2>
</div>

<p  class="drop-cap">A NEW railroad to be called the Gold Belt Cut-off
was being built in California. At a little desert
town named Spur trains arrived with almost
weekly regularity which bore the outfits of contractors who
were to do the work. These trains and others brought many
tramp laborers from all parts of the United States, for
tramps are inseparably connected with big construction in
dirt and rock. Many people imagine that tramps never
work at honest toil. These have never seen a big railroad
in the building.</p>

<p>All was hustle and excitement at Spur this morning, for
two long freight trains, carrying the immense outfit of
the main contractors, Demarest, Spruce and Tillou, had
just rolled in, and a hundred tramps were at the unloading.
A temporary camp was pitched until the outfit was
ready for its forty-mile trip by wagon to the mountains,
where lay the heaviest work. The road was to cross the
San Antonio Range at an altitude of approximately six
thousand feet, and there the aged hills were being torn
asunder.</p>

<p>Hundreds of horses and mules were led from the stock
cars, and turned over to the stable boss and his helpers.
The cooks were busy over several great ranges, set up
temporarily in the open, and the air was filled with the
odors of coffee and frying ham. Knocked-down wagons
and grading implements were being thrown together. The
walking boss rode about on his saddle horse, fat and prancing
from its long confinement on the train, bawling orders<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
to which no one paid attention. Bales of alfalfa hay by
the ton were being opened, and mules brayed and horses
whinnied.</p>

<p>To the stable boss came Joshua Cole, grave-eyed and slim.
Joshua had just left a freight train that had come to rest
at Spur, and the train crew had let him ride for a hundred
miles because he was headed for this scene of intense
activity.</p>

<p>To the stable boss he said:</p>

<p>“Got a job?”</p>

<p>“Sure—a hundred of ’em. Don’t bother me! You a
skinner?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Joshua. “But I’m a hammerman, too, and
I prefer to work in rock.”</p>

<p>“Then see the walker. Or just go to work unloadin’.
Don’t bother anybody about a job, young fella. Help yourself.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” said Joshua.</p>

<p>“Huh!” said the stable boss.</p>

<p>Joshua walked toward the nearest car of the train, from
which men were dragging bundles of tents, heavy tent poles,
and all manner of camp paraphernalia. He noticed a squat,
wide-chested man with a broad-brimmed tan hat on his
head, who, though undemonstrative, stood watching the unloading
in a half-aloof, half-interested manner which gave
him an air of commandership. Toward him Joshua directed
his steps, and as he drew nearer he took note of
finely chiseled features, heavy iron-gray hair, and kindly
slate-colored eyes that looked out from under craggy brows
as black as a campfire kettle. They made thick arches, and
here and there solitary hairs that were thrice as long as the
others stuck out like the spines of a cactus. A stubby gray
beard covered the lower portion of his face, and the rest of
it was brown as a cascara berry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>“Are you the boss here?” asked the wayfarer.</p>

<p>“Yep”—and the kindly slate eyes gave Joshua a keen,
quizzical look that seemed to catalogue him from A to Z.</p>

<p>“I want to go to work.”</p>

<p>“Hop to it.”</p>

<p>Here was invitation enough, so Joshua fell in at the
end of the line of men moving to and from the car, and
when he reached the door took upon his shoulders the tongue
of a wheeled scraper that was handed out. He carried it
to where a group of men were assembling all sorts of grading
implements, and returned for another load.</p>

<p>For about fifteen minutes he made the same round, carrying
anything that was handed out, often assuming a quarter
or a half of some heavy piece of freight too cumbersome
for a single man. And as he worked he frequently caught
the slate eyes of the squat boss upon him.</p>

<p>This man attracted him strangely. The odd contrast of
iron-gray hair and coal-black brows made the man’s face
compelling. The slate-blue eyes, too, added to the contrast,
and the myriad crow’s-feet that made a fine network
about them gave the face a kindly personality. He wore a
gray flannel shirt, and his colorless trousers were held up
by a belt. The heels of his boots were high and slender.
The trousers legs covered the tops of them, but they were
rolled up smoothly at the bottoms, displaying four inches
of bootlegs.</p>

<p>At the end of the fifteen minutes a great triangle was
hammered upon in the vicinity of where the cooks labored.
Instantly every man dropped whatever he had in hand and
hurried in the direction of the odorous ham and coffee.</p>

<p>No tables had been set up, and the tramp laborers formed
a line, took their food in their hands from the cook’s helpers
in the form of sandwiches, and sat on the ground under
lofty cottonwoods. With a cup of smoking coffee in one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
hand, two hot fried-ham sandwiches in the other, and an
enormous boiled potato in his pocket, Joshua Cole found a
place. And as he seated himself he saw, likewise laden and
coming toward him, the squat man who had awakened his
interest. To his surprise the man came directly to his tree,
squatted on his heels with a little grunt, and deposited his
grub before him in a nest of clean, slick leaves.</p>

<p>“Hot as hell, ain’t it?” he vouchsafed. “Thought I’d
like to make yer acquaintance, pardner. You ain’t a tramp,
I take it?”</p>

<p>The last sentence was a question, and Joshua made
reply: “Yes, I’ve been a tramp for over a year.”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh—I savvy.” The man imbedded a set of perfect
white teeth in a ham sandwich to the ruination of nearly
half of it. Then, with his mouth full, he talked on, thus:</p>

<p>“Uh-huh—I get ye, pardner. Guess I been a tramp myself.
One right now, f’r that matter. But I mean a reg’lar
tramp—like these here jaspers here.” He waved the
doomed remainder of the sandwich in a semi-circle to indicate
the squatting diners.</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps not,” Joshua agreed with him. “Anyway,
I’m on the bum and needed a job.”</p>

<p>“Here, too. I drifted in here from up about Wild
Woman Springs. Been drivin’ stage since the Lord knows
when between Wild Woman an’ the mines up at G-string
Mountain. Six-up over seventeen miles o’ the worst grade
in the San Antones. Then what d’ye think they done?
Built a new road and put on automobiles. Result—California
Bill Fox loses his job. Broke, as always, o’ course.
So I drifts down here to Spur yistiddy, and to-day when
this outfit rambles in I hits the boss for a freightin’ job.
Guess I got it, ’cause I know this country. An’ he took
a likin’ to me, seems, for he made me a straw boss over
the unloadin’ until the outfit’s ready to move. That’s me,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
pardner—an’ I ain’t a tramp, rightly speakin’. I know
you ain’t either. But what I’m tryin’ to get at is, what
are you? Course I ain’t aimin’ to be too bold.”</p>

<p>“Well,” Joshua replied, “I guess I’m not much of
anything. I’m from the East—away back, almost on the
Atlantic. I was broke, and I rambled West. I worked here
and there all over the country at one thing and another,
and I’ve been on the railroad grade several times. I
worked for three months on a little job on the M. K. and T.,
and in Texas a while on the Southern Pacific. I learned
how to drive a team and I worked in heavy rock a little in
Colorado. I can use a striking hammer and handle powder
fairly well. That’s what I like best.”</p>

<p>“Not here,” disagreed California Bill Fox. “Me for
the <i>caballos</i>. I do know horses an’ mules, but I ain’t keen
f’r tearin’ up the earth. I like to get behind a ramblin’
six o’ Western ponies and tear <i>over</i> the earth, but tearin’
her up goes ag’in’ the grain. Guess I’m what ye might
call one o’ these here nature lovers. I find rocks an’ trees
kinda friendly, ye understand. An’ I’d rather look at the
sun settin’ over a mountain-top than a three-ring circus.
I’m an old nut about flowers and things like that, an’ I
ain’t perticular who knows it. I c’n kill a man, but not a
deer. An’ that ain’t sayin’ I don’t like venison, either.
D’ye think I’m quaint, pardner?”</p>

<p>Joshua laughed at the suddenness of the question, which
in itself was indisputably quaint. “You may be that,” he
said, “but if you are, it’s nothing to be ashamed of.”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh—I get ye. Thought maybe you’d turn out to
be like that when I was watchin’ ye this mornin’. These
here stiffs get my goat, an’ I can’t tolerate ’em. I was
wonderin’ if they wasn’t somebody in all this mess o’
humanity that I could cotton to, and then you come and
I know immediate that you was different. That there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
word ‘different’ is all-fired handy, ain’t it? I see it in
every story I read, pretty near. The heroine says to the
hero, ‘You’re different,’ an’ he lets out a sigh an’ shoots
back, ‘You’re different, too’—an’ on the next page she’s
callin’ him dear heart. Get two folks together that’s different,
an’ the stuff’s all off—seems.”</p>

<p>Joshua laughed. “Do you read lots?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m a great reader. That’s what makes me different,
I guess. I’m a character, pardner.” The keen
eyes studied Joshua from under their black shelter. “On
the desert and in the mountains I’m just Ole California
Bill, but on the inside I’m a character. The inside is what
we call the country on the other side o’ the range—where
the big towns and cities are. Folks from over there would
come to the desert and ride in my stage up into the mountains,
an’ before we’d got to Shirt-tail Bend some skirt
would whisper to another one that here was a character.
Ain’t that nice? Now what would you say they mean—that
I’m loco—off my nut?”</p>

<p>“Well, not exactly, perhaps,” ventured Joshua.
“Wouldn’t you rather be called a character than to travel
along through life unnoticed—just one of the herd? Seems
to me that’s only a careless way of saying that you are
original—have individuality.”</p>

<p>“D’ye think so?”</p>

<p>“Sure.”</p>

<p>“I see I’m gonta cotton to you a lot, pardner,” said
California Bill. “Say, when we ramble out, you make it
to ride with me on my freight wagon—if I get one. Will
ye? I wonder if ye’ve got any particular hobby that maybe
both of us could talk about.”</p>

<p>“Science? Astronomy?” suggested Joshua.</p>

<p>“Know anythin’ about ’em? I sure do like to talk
about things—kinda wonder about things, ye understand.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
Me f’r the why-are-we-here business every time. The
desert an’ the mountains makes a fella thataway—seems.
Say, I’ve wondered about why I’m here so much that I
think I’ve got the answer. But, then, ye’ll only think I’m
a nut—so why bother ye? And I wonder about stars and
the moon a lot, too. Sun don’t interest me much, except
that, seein’ all life depends on the sun, I c’n sympathize
with the sun-worshipers without half tryin’. But the sun’s
too all-fired prominent to raise my curiosity. The moon
and stars, now, I c’n look up at them without havin’ my
eyes put out. And say—wonder! Leave it to me! D’ye
know anythin’ at all about astronomy?”</p>

<p>“A little.”</p>

<p>The slate eyes studied Joshua again. “Ye was well
raised, I c’n see that,” said California Bill. “Maybe ye
ain’t talkin’ through yer hat. I’ve seen men an’ men—I
think I know ’em pretty well. I took men to the penitentiary— That
is, I mean I seen men goin’ to the penitentiary
that could reel off Shakespeare an’ trigonometry an’
socialism—say! An’ one fella that I saw knew more about
this here Einstein than Einstein does ’imself. ’Tleast, it
sounded like he did to me. Ye can’t tell about men from
th’ clothes they wear ner the job they got, ner nothin’
like that—but I’m a hog fer readin’ their face. Well, you
ride with me an’ we’ll talk about astronomy. I’m harmless.
Just a character.”</p>

<p>“Have you lived in California long?” asked Joshua.</p>

<p>“Longer’n that. I lived here forever.”</p>

<p>“Forever?”</p>

<p>“Fifty-three year, if ye press me, pardner. An’ I’m
fifty-three year old. What call’d they have to brand me
California Bill Fox if I’d ever been anywhere else? I was
born here an’ ain’t ever goin’ to leave. That’s forever far’s
I’m concerned.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>California Bill found it impossible to talk while he
gulped down half a cup of hot coffee, so Joshua took the
opportunity to shift the conversation into the channel that
he wanted it to travel.</p>

<p>“Have you been up where the road is building?” he
asked.</p>

<p>California Bill lowered his granite cup. “Yeah—a billion
times. But that’s before a railroad was thought of.
The new wagon road’s just been finished to G-string,
though, an’ I drove stage up there right along until Saturday
week ago. Then the Old West says, ‘Bill, I’m passin’.
It’s up to you. What’re ye doin’?’ An’ I says, ‘I
pass, too.’”</p>

<p>“Know any of the contractors up there?”</p>

<p>“Pretty near all of ’em—seems. Some of ’em been on
the job six months, ye know. These people, the main contractors,
didn’t move in until they couldn’t sub-let any
more of the work. Then they hadta take holt an’ handle
what was left—and they got a rarin’ tough job, too.”</p>

<p>“Back in Utah, as I was traveling West,” said Joshua
thoughtfully, “a stiff who had been working here told
me that a man called Bloodmop Mundy had a piece on the
Gold Belt Cut-off. Is that so?”</p>

<p>“Well, it was until about three months ago, an’ then he
ups and dies.”</p>

<p>“He’s dead?”</p>

<p>“Well, they planted him, anyway,” drawled California
Bill. “I reckon their intentions was good. Nice <i>hombre</i>.
His daughter is runnin’ the outfit now. That is, her and
her maw; but Madge is the boss because Mis’ Mundy is
retirin’ like. Some kid, this here Shanty Madge. Pretty
as sunset on a mountain lake. An’ she’s makin’ good with
the work, but they got a whopper of a job. One o’ these
days a whole blame hill’s gonta fall down on ’em; an’ then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
I’m thinkin’ somethin’s gonta go bust. Bloodmop was
makin’ good for the last sev’r’l years, they tell me. Started
in as a gypo man back East, with a few old skates an’ a
handful o’ geed-up tools. Come West an’ branched out,
and was swingin’ big jobs in Nevada an’ California. Then
he took this one, subbin’ offen Demarest, Spruce an’ Tillou—biggest
thing he’d so far undertook—seems. An’ then—just
gettin’ a good start—he croaked. But Shanty Madge’ll
swing it, if that confoun’ hill don’t come down on her an’
ruin her complete. There goes th’ blame’ triangle, an’ we
gotta get to work. Say, I didn’t get yer name, ol’-timer.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI<br>

<small>THE ROAD TO G-STRING</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">SO the end of Joshua Cole’s quest was at hand. Up
there somewhere in the mountains was Madge Mundy—“Shanty”
Madge, as California Bill had called
her. He wondered, as he worked that afternoon, what she
would be like. He knew why they called her Shanty Madge,
for he remembered all that she had told him about “gypo”
men and “shanty” men, as small contractors were called
on the railroad grade, and since leaving his home town he
had worked in several camps, so that he was familiar with
the vernacular. She would be over eighteen now, and he
tried to picture her at such an age. But always his mind
presented the photograph of a pretty little girl with expressive
Oriental-topaz eyes, and red-gold hair streaming
down her back, with skin the color of the mythical Indian
girl who saved John Smith’s life.</p>

<p>And Bloodmop Mundy was dead. Aside from Beaver
Clegg, Joshua had known no other man friend, and he had
warmed instinctively to the bluff, rough-and-ready gypo
man. Would Mrs. Mundy remember him? He had liked
Mrs. Mundy, and now, with the experience of years to aid
him, he was able to look back and wonder at her serenity
and her strange devotion to a man of Bloodmop Mundy’s
type.</p>

<p>Joshua was unpresentable. His clothes were frayed and
his hair needed trimming. His shoes, too, were relics; and
altogether he made a disreputable-looking figure. He must
work at the camp of Demarest, Spruce and Tillou, he told
himself, until he had earned enough money to buy respectable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
clothes before seeking Madge. And the thought
of seeking her filled his heart with dread. She might
remember him, but that would be about all. Surely, since
she had grown up a hundred men had made love to her.
Was she still interested in the stars?</p>

<p>Another train rolled into Spur, carrying the third section
of Demarest, Spruce and Tillou’s outfit, before they were
ready to take up the long, tiresome trip to the mountains.
But on the third day after Joshua’s coming the first six-horse
team moved out ahead of a wagonload of tents, and
one by one others fell in behind it until the long train,
stretched out over the desert, was more than a mile in
length.</p>

<p>Joshua rode with California Bill, who drove six big
slick mules hitched to a tremendous load of baled alfalfa.
They had a place midway in the train. The wagons
rumbled over the bridge that crossed the river flowing
through the town, ascended a sharp grade hacked in a
rocky butte, and reached a level plateau beyond. Here,
far as the eye could see, stretched the sandy desert, bare in
spots, but for the most part covered sparsely with sage and
greasewood. Jack-rabbits loped off down the avenues between
the breast-high plants, bronze-green in the brilliant
sunlight. A coyote stared at them, ears erect, then vanished.
Here grew a clump of stately yuccas, that mysterious
tree of the desert with swords for leaves and a trunk as
pithy as a cornstalk. There in the mirage-steeped distance
a desert whirlwind traveled along, a funnel-shaped pillar
of sand and dust that scarce seemed to move, but which
in reality was sweeping along at dizzying speed. Dust
clouds arose from the wagon train and hung in the air.
The dust was filled with alkali, and it stung the lips and
the eyes and made men frequently seek the desert water-bags
that hung handy on every wagon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>California Bill lolled on his high seat and smoked brown-paper
cigarettes. Somehow, Joshua thought, his bearded
lips and his mature years called for a corn-cob pipe, but Bill
was too strongly Western for that.</p>

<p>They talked of many things, and as Joshua’s confidence
in the man grew firmer he told the strange story of his
life, omitting nothing. From time to time, as he listened,
California Bill sagely nodded his head, as if all matters in
the universe were understood by him.</p>

<p>“Well, Tony,” he remarked, as Joshua came to a pause
and looked off over the desert with unseeing gray-blue eyes,
“you’ve had enough experience to make a man out of you,
and I guess it’s done it.”</p>

<p>“Don’t call me Tony,” objected Joshua. “That name
calls up memories that are not all pleasant.”</p>

<p>“I was just thinkin’,” said Bill. “Seems to me that
name’s kinda appropriate. It set you apart from the other
kids in the House of Refuge—seems—and it meant somethin’.
If I was you, I’d take that name just to kinda spit
in the face of Old Lady Fate. D’ye get what I mean?
S’pose, f’r instance, that an hombre was to peddle me a
salted mine and went away chucklin’ in his sleeve. Then
s’pose that mine was to unexpectedly show a big pay
streak, and make me rich. Now ye get me. Joshua ain’t
any kind of a name for a jasper like you, anyway. When
ye get to be a big astronomer, which ye will some day,
Joshua’ll be plumb <i>hi-yu-skookum</i>—which is Cayuse Indian
for ‘mighty fine’—but out here on the desert an’ in
the mountains Tony sounds more sociable. Le’s make it
Tony. Tony Cole—that’s <i>muy bueno</i>. But ten years from
now Dr. Joshua Cole will be the proper caper. Ye must ’a’
learned a lot from that ole Clegg party, Tony.”</p>

<p>“He taught me all that I know,” Joshua replied.</p>

<p>“I’d like to ’a’ met that man,” said California Bill. “I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
cottoned to him the minute you began to tell about ’im. I
like ugly men. Somehow er nuther they seem the most
dependable.”</p>

<p>“I heard something about you yesterday,” Joshua told
him. “They tell me you were once deputy sheriff of one
of the northern counties in California.”</p>

<p>“Did they? Huh! Yes, I puttered around a bit at that
job.”</p>

<p>“And I was told, too, that you are without fear—that
you are a deadly gunman and have half a dozen bullet
holes in your body.”</p>

<p>“Shucks, now! Who’s been talkin’ behind my back?”</p>

<p>“A man who lives at Spur told me. Is it true?”</p>

<p>“Is what true?”</p>

<p>“That you are fearless?”</p>

<p>“Course it ain’t true. No man is fearless. Why, I’ve
heard my own teeth rattlin’ like seed in a pod many a time.
Look away over yonder at the mountains, Tony. See that
deep scar? That’s Caldron Cañon—hottest place anywhere
about here. An’ to the left of it is Buttonhook Bend, where
they usta hold up the mail stage for G-string. Old road—abandoned
now. And ahead, if ye’ll stand up, ye c’n see
a square o’ green on the desert. Looks like an emerald in
the middle of a khaki blanket, don’t it? That’s Box-R
Ranch. Artesian wells—the only water between here and
Wild Woman Springs. We’ll camp there.”</p>

<p>“Have you ever killed a man, Bill?” Joshua persisted.</p>

<p>“Who, me? Reminds me of ole Seth Spicer, that usta
be up in Mendocino County in the big-timber belt. Fella
ast ’im how many bear he’d killed. ‘When?’ says Seth.
‘Why, in yer life?’ says the fella. ‘In my <i>whole</i> life?’ says
Seth. ‘Why, son, ye don’t expect me to recollect that, do
ye? But I remember killin’ forty-seven one winter.’ But
it ain’t as bad as that with me, Tony. I plugged a couple<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
er more, I guess, in my time. But I don’t like to think
about it. I’m powerful peaceful, me. That’s why I quit
dep’ty-sheriffin’—don’t like to be packin’ a gat and smokin’
up the scenery any too well. That’s what I call plumb
<i>cultus</i>—which, seein’ ye’re an Easterner, means ‘very bad.’
I like hosses an’ mules an’ trees an’ rocks—seems. Now
tell me somethin’ more about Mars an’ the moon. I never
get sick o’ that stuff. Is ole Mars inhabited, d’ye think?”</p>

<p>They camped at Box-R Ranch in the middle of the afternoon,
and were away again before the sun was up. Next
afternoon found the crawling worm that was the wagon
train at Wild Woman Springs, which for years had been
nothing but a watering station on the road to G-string, but
which, since the coming of the nomad laborers, had become
a frontier village boasting eleven houses. Every house was
built of new, resinous pine and corrugated iron, and all
sheltered gambling devices, rude bars, restaurant counters,
bunks for the exhausted, and floors upon which to dance
with the highly painted female denizens of the dives. Here
were Scotty’s Place, The Palace Dance Hall, The Gem,
Poker Dan’s, The Midway, Shoestring Charley’s, Cowboy
Mary’s Place, The Forget-me-not, and others with names
as suggestive and picturesque. A mile or more from Wild
Woman Springs the outfit next morning left the desert and
began the sharp ascent into the abrupt mountains. They
reached Yucca Flat at noon, where they camped, and at
two o’clock they entered upon the new road to G-string
which had robbed California Bill of his six-up express and
made of him a six-mule freighter.</p>

<p>There was one more night’s camp before they crawled
to the summit, which took place in the middle of the following
morning. For hours the air had been growing
cooler. All the majestic bleakness of the desert had passed
and now friendly pines and tinkling streams and lofty,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
distant peaks greeted the tired travelers. Then they wound
down into a level mountain valley where gleamed a tranquil
lake.</p>

<p>“Stirrup Lake,” Bill named it. “An’ the mountain
over there that looks down on it is Saddle Mountain.
G-string is at the foot of it, but we don’t go that way.
We’ll lead ’round the lake on the east and follow the south
shore. See those peaks over there to the west? That’s
where we’re headin’ for—that’s where the railroad’s comin’
through the mountains. Shanty Madge is there.”</p>

<p>He looked quickly with his keen, slate-colored eyes at
his companion, the dense black brows lifted inquiringly.</p>

<p>“So ye knew Madge when she was a kid, hey?” he asked.
“Eleven, did ye say?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Joshua, and he felt the heat growing in his
face.</p>

<p>“Well, she’s over eighteen now, I guess. She’s good
f’r the eyes. I’ve seen a lotta women handlin’ men’s jobs
in the West, Tony, but none just like Shanty Madge. She’s
different—there’s that confoun’ handy word again! But
Madge is educated—they say her mother was a wizard at
bringin’ her up—an’ she ain’t like any female pioneer that
I ever knew before. She’s a good scout and all that, democratic
an’ free, but she’s—well, confoun’ that word!—she’s
different. Figger it out f’r yerself. D’ye think ye’re in
love with her, son?”</p>

<p>California Bill’s abruptness was often disconcerting.
Joshua’s face went red as fire, and his eyes failed to meet
the freighter’s.</p>

<p>“Excuse me, Tony,” Bill said gently. “I’m always
shootin’ from the pocket—seems. But I know what brung
ye out here—just that an’ nothin’ else. Shut up like ye
was in that there he-convent, seein’ no girls, ye just kep’
on thinkin’ of the little girl ye met in the gypo camp, an’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
when ye broke corral ye loped for her. But I wanta tell
ye, son, that Madge is what ye might call a grown woman
now—though at that she’s only a kid—and she’s a mighty
much admired skirt. Why, young Montgomery, son of the
big Montgomery of Montgomery and Applegate, big contractors,
is after Madge hot an’ heavy. I ain’t meanin’ to
discourage ye, Tony—but right now ye’re only a tramp,
an’— Well, figger it out f’r yerself.”</p>

<p>“I’m not going to see her until I’ve earned enough
money to buy some decent clothes,” Joshua told California
Bill. “I’m a pretty good powderman—it’s the only thing
that appeals to me in railroad construction.”</p>

<p>“That comes o’ yer scientific mind,” said Bill.</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” Joshua agreed. “But the best of it is
that a good powderman has a chance to get somewhere, it
seems to me, and I’m going to try for a foreman’s job as
soon as a chance offers.”</p>

<p>“Ye’re pretty young.”</p>

<p>“I realize that. But I’m confident that I can get something
before very long. The outfit is as yet short of men—there
ought to be a chance for me. Well, until I get on
my feet, anyway, I won’t see Madge.”</p>

<p>“She’s used to tramps enough,” mused Bill. “But that
ain’t sayin’ she’ll fall in love with one. I’m bettin’ on ye,
though, Tony. Don’t get discouraged. An’ whatever ye
do, don’t give up astronomy. That’s what ye’ve set yer
heart on, an’ that’s what ye know best. Get on yer feet,
make up to Shanty Madge, make her love ye, an’ then get
outa here an’ go on with yer studies. If Madge is what I
think she is, she’d say the same. An’ she’ll wait f’r ye,
too. That is, that’s the way I’m bettin’. You’ll win, Tony—it’s
in yer eye. Ye been through hell, an’ ye come out of
it rarin’ an’ prancin’ an’ gnawin’ yer bit. Ye’re a fightin’
fool—my money’s on ye, son! Now here we go ’round the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
east end o’ the lake. Come three o’clock we’ll be there, an’
then—”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll begin my life,” said Joshua.</p>

<p>California Bill sighed deeply and looked away over
Stirrup Lake toward Saddle Mountain, red in the sunlight.
“Then ye’ll begin,” he muttered softly. “Lord! Lord!
What must it be like to be young and talkin’ about beginnin’!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII<br>

<small>AMBITIONS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">HALF of the outfit of Demarest, Spruce and Tillou
went into permanent camp on a timbered plateau
three miles from the lake, thus establishing Camp
Number One. The other half journeyed on six miles down
the mountain valley that extended in the direction of the
coast, where it became Camp Two.</p>

<p>Joshua Cole remained at Camp One, which grew to a
white-tent city during the several closely following days.
This mountain country thrilled him. The air was light and
cool, and the objects of Nature’s handiwork stood out in
bold relief. The pine forests looked as if they had been
newly painted, so bright were the greens, so contrasting the
delicate browns. Lofty peaks covered with untarnished
snow looked down upon the camp, and the placid lake lay
like a blue teardrop in the hollow of a gigantic, caressing
hand. Lush meadows surrounded the lake, and here grazed
innumerable cattle, the property of Box-R Ranch, down
on the desert. All winter long they had cropped bunchgrass
that grew under sage bushes on the sandy waste, and
had just been driven into the mountains for the summer
pasture of saltgrass and bluejoint. Occasionally Joshua
saw cowpunchers working with them and heard their shouting
from afar.</p>

<p>He had gone to work as soon as the big camp was established,
swinging a striking hammer on a drill head, with
three others to complete the crew. The work was represented
by a gigantic cut through solid rock, and, but for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
that in the hands of Shanty Madge, was the most difficult
on the entire job.</p>

<p>Joshua had become an artistic hammerman, and, though
the youngest man in his crew, he was a welcome addition.
Always quiet and reserved, he had none of the qualities that
often make youth obnoxious to such old-timers as it fell to
his lot to labor with. And as he swung his striking hammer
or turned the drill he thought of Madge Mundy of the
frizzly bronze-gold hair, and wondered if ever he would
find courage to go to her.</p>

<p>He began to realize now, with the girl so close to him,
that he had come upon a wild-goose chase to seek her in the
West. Since he had seen her last she had traveled over the
United States and had had many experiences. While he
on the other hand had been shut up behind gray walls with
Clegg and his books and the telescope. His meeting with
her had been a momentous episode in his life, for directly
afterward he had been committed to the House of Refuge,
where one lived over and over the bright spots in his past.
But it was doubtful now if Madge even would remember
him. More and more, as the days passed, he shrank from
going to her camp.</p>

<p>California Bill had returned to Spur for more supplies
directly after the first long pull into the mountains. Now,
one evening, his six slick mules rolled into camp ahead of a
load of grain and groceries, and Joshua met him as he
came, weary and dusty but wearing his never-failing smile,
from the stable tent.</p>

<p>“I’m goin’ to the Mundys’ camp to-morrow mornin’,”
he said. “They’re gettin’ low on dynamite, an’ the boss
says f’r me to hook up my wheelers an’ take ’em enough to
tide ’em over till their freighters ramble in. To-morrow’s
Sunday—better come along, Tony.”</p>

<p>“No, I’m not ready yet,” Joshua replied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>The slate-blue eyes studied him carefully. “Scared, eh?”</p>

<p>“I look so tough,” Joshua evaded. “I’ll wait till I’ve
earned enough to get some halfway-decent clothes.”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh”—and California Bill waddled away to his
bunk tent to prepare for supper.</p>

<p>Joshua did not see him again until Monday morning, and
then he was perched on his high seat behind his long-eared
hybrids, on his way to Spur for more supplies. And that
same afternoon, as Joshua was turning a drill under the
ringing blows of his three fellow-workmen, he heard the
thud of horses’ hoofs close by, and the voice of the walking
boss calling to the hammermen:</p>

<p>“Hold ’em a minute, fellas!”</p>

<p>The blows ceased. Joshua gave his drill a twist and
looked up at two mounted figures. One was the walker on
his big roan mare, and the other was a girl on a black
gelding. She wore a flannel shirt open at the neck and
riding breeches. From under a man’s broad-brimmed hat
her large eyes, brown as Oriental topaz, looked straight at
Joshua. Her hair was frizzly and bronze-gold where the
sunbeams caught it.</p>

<p>“Lady wants to see you, Cole,” said the walker. “Let
Bluenose turn the drill awhile.”</p>

<p>As a little girl Madge Mundy had been outstanding.
Her adorably recalcitrant hair, with its strange gleam of
reddish gold, combined with the blended brown-pink coloring
of her flawless skin had made her so. Now, a young
woman rounding to maturity, she would have attracted instant
attention among a hundred girls, all beautiful. Her
beauty was unique, her own, and altogether distracting to
mankind because of its unexpectedness. That amazing,
crinkly hair was now gathered simply at the nape of her
neck and held in place by a ribbon, and below the ribbon
it spread fanwise over her back and shoulders, a gleaming,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
puffy mass of antique gold. But her eyes, as of old, held
the steadfast gaze of the discomfited hammerman. Their
reddish-brown was like the brown of no other eyes that
he had ever seen. The whimsical thought flashed through
his mind that Madge, like the untarnished forests and
mountains all about her, had been newly pumiced and varnished
in honor of his coming.</p>

<p>“Well, Joshua, aren’t you coming to say hello to me?”</p>

<p>Slowly he rose from his seat on a powder can and walked
toward the horses. The walking boss and Joshua’s fellow-hammermen
were watching him narrowly, and his throat
felt dry and parched. He put out his hand as he reached
the side of the black horse, and looked up at her with his
grave gray-blue eyes.</p>

<p>“Hello,” he said obediently.</p>

<p>The walker snorted, and the girl’s laughter rang out
with a clearness that somehow seemed to match her eyes
and her skin and her even little teeth. If she had laughed
any other way, thought Joshua, the entire effect of her
individuality would have been set at naught.</p>

<p>“How did—California Bill told you I was here, of
course.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Bill tells me everything. I have him hypnotized.”</p>

<p>He had taken her strong brown hand and held it until
it occurred to him to pump her arm up and down and
release his hold, which he did with boyish vigor.</p>

<p>“And so you’re West at last. We’ve thought about you
a thousand times. And when are you coming to tell Ma
and me all about it? Next Sunday?”</p>

<p>“I—I can come then.”</p>

<p>“I wish you would. We’ve so much to talk about. We
know about your—where you went when you left us in
Hathaway that night. Pa meant to take me to see you,
but— Well, he didn’t get around to it. We left for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
West only a week afterward. But I mustn’t keep you from
your work. You’ll remember that Ma wouldn’t let me
have a holiday from my lessons when you called on me.
We’ll expect you down Sunday, then. Isn’t it funny that
you’re here after all these years? Good-by!”</p>

<p>She waved a hand at him and smiled and swung the black
about. The walking boss fell in behind her, and she rode
back the way she had come. Joshua slowly returned to his
seat on a powder can and mechanically took the drill from
Bluenose.</p>

<p>“Good-night, kid!” muttered that expert powderman.
“Say, you’re it! Dat dame’s got ’em all crazy. How’d
youse make de riffle?”</p>

<p>“I knew her back East when we were kids,” said Joshua
simply. “Let’s go!”</p>

<p>And the music of the hammers began again.</p>

<p>Saturday evening Joshua Cole had charged to his account
by the commissary clerk the following resplendent
raiment:</p>

<table>
<tr><td>1 Stetson Hat</td><td class="tdr">                   $7.50</td></tr>

</table>

<p>And Bluenose cut his coal-black hair for nothing, for
which cruelty Bluenose should have had the straight-jacket.</p>

<p>Then, next morning, he walked six miles and called on
Madge and Mrs. Mundy.</p>

<p>The camp of the Mundys was on a lowland flat, covered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
sparsely with bull pines. Because of the big shots that
were being fired day by day the tents were nearly a quarter
of a mile from the work. The task of Shanty Madge and
her mother was, as California Bill Fox had proclaimed,
enormous. It consisted for the most part of a long tunnel
through the bowels of a rounded hill, which jutted out obstinately
into the deep cañon that the right-of-way was
trying to follow. The hill had been without a name until
the coming of the construction men, but now it was known
as the Hill of Springs.</p>

<p>Its top was composed of grainy soil and shattered rottenstone,
and in this porous formation frequent springs bubbled
up. Some of them were mud springs, and spurted up
blue batter to a height of several feet. Others spouted soda-and-magnesia
water. But all were inconsiderately moist.</p>

<p>This moisture leaked into the tunnel all the time, and
made the operations there damp and difficult and a constant
aid to rheumatism. But the worst of it was that Madge
feared the entire top of the hill might slide into the tunnel
at any unexpected moment, and the work went ahead cautiously
and with the slowness that caution calls for. And
Shanty Madge was worried.</p>

<p>She met Joshua at the door of the tent in which she and
her mother lived. A cluster of lofty pines stood about it,
and it was screened and had a floor of tongue-and-groove.
It was white and clean, and the few furnishings within were
tastefully arranged. In the mountain camp, it was a little
oasis in canvas, touched by the magic hand of woman, which
leaves its delicate imprint wherever it is reached forth to
make a habitation.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mundy was graying a little, but she was as wholesome
and serene as ever. As when he was a boy, she
talked with Joshua in a sincere manner and listened to him
with that courteous, undivided attention which puts one at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
his ease and is the topmost pinnacle of good breeding.
Joshua did not mean to intimate such a thing, but he said
something that morning that proved his puzzlement over
Mrs. Mundy’s devotion to a man of the stamp of Bloodmop.
And, showing no offense, she explained it simply:</p>

<p>“Why, when I was eighteen the man just swept me off
my feet with his irresistible love-making, and after I’d
surrendered he kept me off my feet with his everlasting
goodness.”</p>

<p>Madge, trim and neat in her olive-drab shirt and bellows
breeches, sat by and listened to her mother and Joshua talk.
She seemed to hear everything that was being said and to
be drawing as many conclusions as if she were engaging
in the conversation, but her clear brown eyes were faraway
and dreamy. She looked almost boyish as she sat
there, hands thrust into trousers pockets, her slim, rounded
legs crossed and stretched out before her.</p>

<p>“And now,” said Elizabeth Mundy, “tell me how you
and your friends the stars are getting on.”</p>

<p>At once Madge’s eyes lost their dreaminess, and she
looked at Joshua alertly, patently interested in what his
reply would be.</p>

<p>Then out came the story of life in the House of Refuge
and of Beaver Clegg and his wondrous telescope.</p>

<p>“Why, you’ve accomplished marvels!” Madge finally interrupted.
“Here we’ve been feeling sorry for you, and
now you tell us that you’ve been helped on toward the goal
of your ambition in a way that never would have happened
if you’d not been sent to that reformatory.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I learned a lot from Mr. Clegg,” said Joshua.
“But now I’ve got to begin at the beginning again. Science
is progressing by leaps and bounds these days, and unless
a fellow is in constant touch with new developments he’s
out of luck. My first payday goes back to Hathaway for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
my books and Clegg’s notes and the photographs. If there’s
any left I’ll subscribe to several scientific magazines and
try to catch up. Last Sunday I found a cave about a mile
from our camp. Just stumbled onto it. I’m going to appropriate
it as a study and laboratory, and I’ll spend all of
my spare time there. I can give at least three or four hours
every night, and all day of every Sunday, to study. I’m a
hound for work, if I do say it myself, and I’ll be caught
up before this job is finished in the mountains. Then I hope
to put another new idea to work.</p>

<p>“I discovered something else last Sunday. Before I’d
stumbled onto the cave I walked around the lake to the
other side, and climbed that rocky ridge over there to see
if I could get a view of the desert. It’s a steep climb, but
I made it—and, say, the view is marvelous. For miles and
miles, far as the eye can reach—and I was told by the
doctor at the House of Refuge that I have particularly good
eyes—the desert sweeps below you, the most magnificent
sight on earth. It seemed that from that particular mountain-top—for
it is a miniature mountain—objects on the
desert stood out with a clearness almost unbelievable. I
turned and looked into the range at the forests and peaks,
and they too seemed clearer than I had ever seen them
before. And I got to thinking.</p>

<p>“It strikes me that there is something mighty peculiar
over there on that ridge. To the west of us lies the coast—to
the east the desert. All of the western slopes of the
range, they tell me, are covered with trees—great forests of
pine. And on the eastern slopes nothing much grows but
scrubby piñons, cactus, yuccas, and sage. You can almost
see the dividing line at the lake shore. Haven’t you noticed
that there are no pine forests on the other side of the lake,
and that they begin abruptly on this side? So over there
we have the influence of the dry desert in the atmosphere,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
while at the same time we have an altitude of over six
thousand feet.</p>

<p>“Well, all this seems to make for the clearest atmosphere
on top of that ridge that I have ever seen. And I’m
going up there to-night to see what it’s like after dark. If
I’m right, that mountain that I stood on last Sunday is
the most marvelous spot on earth, atmospherically, for
astronomical observations. And if repeated visits prove
that I am right as to the atmosphere’s rare transparency—”</p>

<p>“Yes, go on,” urged Madge.</p>

<p>“Well, then that’s <i>my</i> mountain,” replied Joshua, “and
I’ll install a telescope there and astonish the world of
science. That is—perhaps.”</p>

<p>“But where will you get your telescope?” asked Madge’s
mother.</p>

<p>Joshua threw out his hands in a gesture of submission.
“I’ll have to earn it,” he told her. “And the one that was
given to me cost Mr. Clegg five hundred dollars. Whew!
And I’m only a hammerman for Demarest, Spruce and
Tillou. But that doesn’t discourage me. I’ll earn the
money in time. And while I’m doing that I’ll make a
telescope for myself—one that will do for the time being,
anyway.”</p>

<p>“Make one!” exclaimed Madge.</p>

<p>“Yes, I think I can. Among my notes, back in Hathaway,
are directions for making a small home-made glass
that will show the mountains, craters, and plains of the
moon, the rings of Saturn, at least four of the nine satellites
of Jupiter, and at certain times the polar caps of Mars.
Also any large spots that may appear on the disk of the sun.
We have a good blacksmith shop in camp, of course, and I
know Blacky will let me use his tools. Then I’ll use that
telescope until I can buy a five-inch one—which is my great
ambition in life—and then I’ll— Oh, well, I’m boring you,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
I know. I get too enthusiastic over these things, I guess.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t be ashamed of the enthusiasm, Joshua,”
Madge said, her brown eyes dreamy once more. “But tell
me this: Is there any money in it?”</p>

<p>“Money! Who cares for money?”</p>

<p>“But you’ll have to live.”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course. I suppose that’s true. But I can work
on the railroad grade as long as the road is building. That
will be six months to a year, I think. I ought to save some
money in that time. And maybe I can get a job somewhere
about here after the outfits have moved on. There’s
work at G-string, in the mines, isn’t there?”</p>

<p>“You couldn’t work in a mine all day and study the
stars at night, could you?” observed Mrs. Mundy. “It
seems to me that would soon ruin your health.”</p>

<p>“I could ruin a lot of that and still have plenty to spare,”
he laughed with boyish assurance.</p>

<p>“I should think,” Madge offered, “that, rather than do
that, you would want to save up for a university education.”</p>

<p>“No, I think not,” he said musingly. “Clegg was
against it. He said in his whimsical way that he entered
an Eastern university once, but that he quit because it
took too much time from his studies. No, I want to observe
the stellar bodies, not read about them and look at pictures.”</p>

<p>“But, Joshua, don’t they have enormous telescopes at
the universities?”</p>

<p>“Yes, they do,” he conceded. “But right here I’ll tell
you something that you perhaps don’t know. There are
difficulties that arise when an astronomer attempts lunar or
Martian observations with high-powered telescopes that
the layman knows nothing about. This is too involved for
me to attempt an explanation, but believe me when I say<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
that moderate magnifying power, under certain conditions,
has its advantages in the study of Mars and the moon.
Why, some of our greatest discoveries have been made with
small instruments. It’s the transparency of the atmosphere,
the ability of the observer to concentrate and his
constant application, coupled with good vision, that get
results. Oh, on that mountain over there—if I’m right—and
I know I am—”</p>

<p>The older woman was smiling at his enthusiasm and sincerity,
and she saw in him now just what she had expected
of the queer little boy who had come courting her daughter
at breakfast time, and revealed to her the wonders of the
stars that night. Joshua’s handsome, ascetic face was
aglow with the warmth of his feelings, and his tolerant,
gray-blue eyes mirrored the intensity of his thoughts.
“What a lover he’d make,” she mused, but aloud she said:</p>

<p>“You’re only about twenty-one, aren’t you? But you
talk and act like a man of thirty. Are you all for astronomy?
Haven’t you any of the yearnings that most young
men have?”</p>

<p>“Well,” he replied thoughtfully, “there was no use to
yearn in the House of Refuge, and I guess I got out of the
habit of it early. But I’ve always wanted to be a cowboy—honest”—and
his eyes twinkled. “I suppose I am a bit
cramped mentally. I don’t know what I would be like if I
hadn’t been a tramp for a year or more. That took a lot
of the Ethelbert stuff out of me, I guess, and put what
he-man there is into me. Now don’t think I’m a freak.
Because a man’s a scientist he doesn’t have to have stooped
shoulders and be absent-minded and wear glasses as big as
check-strap rings. I’m human and sinful, head over heels
in love with life, and like to play draw poker. And if The
Whimperer did steal my refractor and almost break my
heart, he taught me to smoke tobacco and drink a glass of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
hundred-proof without batting an eye—for the appreciation
of which good things of earth I thank him. Just the
same, I’m a born astronomer. I’m not meaning to be boastful—I
merely was fortunate enough, by a rare fluke, to
find out early in life what I was put here for. And I’m
just telling you. I know I’m boring you, Mrs. Mundy.”</p>

<p>Madge did not give her mother time to say yes or no.
“But you haven’t answered my question,” she said. “Is
there any money in it, Joshua?”</p>

<p>“I’ve hardly considered that,” he told her. “I don’t
want to consider it. But I may gain fame. For about a
year before I left the House of Refuge I was working on a
pet theory of my own. It’s in connection with Mars, which
planet had occupied my interest almost exclusively for some
time before Mr. Clegg died. If I can prove my theory to
be fact— Well, then I’ll make ’em sit up and take notice.
And as for money, why, I can earn all I’ll need right here
in the mountains, I guess. All I want is a living and a
horse to carry me over the mountains and the desert, a little
cabin back from the lake in a clump of sprawling junipers
that I know about—and a five-inch telescope on my hill.”</p>

<p>Madge laughed shortly. “That sounds romantic
enough,” she admitted, “but— Oh, well, come take a ride
with me and I’ll show you what an eighteen-year-old shanty
queen can do. And I warn you right now that I’m mighty
proud of myself, and you must conduct yourself accordingly.
I may never achieve fame, but if we’re reasonably
fortunate we’ll get the money. That’s what counts these
days.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean that at all,” he said hopefully, for
the first time a little disappointed with his Penelope in
bronze.</p>

<p>“Humph! Don’t I? ’By, Ma”—and she led the way out
into the cool sunshine and fresh forest smells.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br>

<small>NEW PROSPECTS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE Mundys’ stable boss saddled for Madge the
black gelding that she had ridden when she called
on Joshua, and for him a blaze-faced bay which had
been Bloodmop’s saddler. Side by side they took up the
trail through the woods, and soon were ascending sharply
to the work above.</p>

<p>They watched the strings of dump-cars traveling swiftly
under momentum from a fifty-foot cut which extended to
the mouth of the drippy tunnel. Muck from the tunnel
was being carried to its dump over another route by men
“pullin’ ’im by the whiskers,” which, in construction parlance,
means leading with a rope a horse or mule hitched to
a cart. They looked on in silence for a time, then Madge
said:</p>

<p>“This means a lot to me, Joshua. You know, I was a
harum-scarum kid when you met me, pretty good with a
team and a wheeler even at that age, and wild about railroading.
Well, I never got over it. It’s my delight to-day.
I love the work and the free-and-easy, democratic life in
the open country. I fell into bossing the job naturally
when poor Pa died, and I’ve been making good. Ma, of
course, thinks it’s no job for a girl, and if we could let
go I guess she’d be willing enough to get me away from
it all. But she’s an old dear—she never tries to make
me quit. Well, why should I? Isn’t this the day when
it’s up to women to show the stuff they’re made of? And
I’ll show ’em, if we can swing this job. Tell me one thing,”
she broke off abruptly: “Why are you here?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>“Why,” Joshua replied, trying to put innocence into
his tones, “didn’t you invite me?”</p>

<p>“I mean why are you out West—on this particular
job?”</p>

<p>He looked her over carefully, the ghost of a smile on his
lips. He was far from disconcerted.</p>

<p>“I may as well confess to the truth,” he told her. “I
came hunting you.”</p>

<p>She drew in her breath slightly.</p>

<p>“Your question was a frank one, Madge—I made my
reply as frank. During all those years in the House of
Refuge I never forgot you. It was my boyish ambition,
you know, to travel West with your father. And when they
nabbed me and put me away I clung to the idea. Then
when I was pardoned I had no place to go. My brother—the
boy for whom I went to the House of Refuge, if you
want to get down to fine points—would have nothing to do
with me. My father, of course, was still impossible. So I
went on the bum and hunted you up. I knew I’d find you
out here somewhere.”</p>

<p>“How did you know that?”</p>

<p>“Well, a hunch, we’ll call it. I wanted desperately to,
and perhaps psychology did the rest.”</p>

<p>For a long time she looked at him searchingly, and then
her reddish lashes hid her eyes. “Let’s get off and have a
look at the tunnel,” she suggested.</p>

<p>She led the way inside the damp cylinder in the hill,
and they watched the human gophers forging ahead
through the solid rock, from the open crevices of which came
a continuous ooze. The men timbered carefully ahead of
them as they progressed, and the huge beams used seemed
capable of withstanding almost any strain.</p>

<p>“Madge,” said he, as they blew out their candles at the
tunnel’s mouth, “I don’t like the looks of things in there.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
Of course I don’t know anything about the nature of the
hilltop, but California Bill says it’s a mass of springs. By
George, if she caves on you you’re ruined.”</p>

<p>“I know it,” she readily agreed. “But we’re praying
that it won’t cave until the concrete gang gets on the job.
We’re timbering heavily, as you saw, and if old Jawbone
only will listen to the walker and me we’ll get by, I think.”</p>

<p>“Who’s Jawbone?”</p>

<p>“The most obstinate old Irish boss-powderman in the
entire game,” she explained. “He’s a wonder, but too
reckless. He’s fired some marvelous shots for us—shots
that have made us big money. But on this kind of work
he’s simply dangerous. I’d as soon think of firing myself,
though, as to fire Jawbone. He’s been with us ever since
we hit the West, and Pa swore by him.”</p>

<p>“How is he dangerous?” asked Joshua.</p>

<p>“Well, he uses too much powder for tunnel work like
this. I tell him—and Steve, the walking boss, does too—that
the big shots he’s firing in there to loosen the muck are
likely to bring the entire hill down on his silly old head.
He growls at us and keeps right on. He’s one of these
faithful-old-retainer types—been with the outfit so long
that he thinks he owns it. And he takes advantage of me
since Pa died, thinking, of course, that I’m in his hands and
helpless without him. But he got a little slide the other
day and eased up a lot on the giant, and I’m hoping he
learned a lesson before it is too late. If he’ll only stay
sober! But the minute he gets a few drinks under his belt
he’ll get reckless again.”</p>

<p>“I’d watch him like a hawk, then,” was Joshua’s advice.
“If that wet hill slides down in your tunnel— Well, then
you’ll be mighty busy, to say the least.”</p>

<p>“I know it,” she returned. “And I confess I’m worried.
But I can’t fire Jawbone—you don’t understand, perhaps.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
I have one of his own men watching him on the sly, and
I’ll know it if he begins shooting heavily again.”</p>

<p>Joshua left the camp of the Mundys at three o’clock in
the afternoon and walked slowly homeward. His reception
and subsequent treatment by the two women had warmed
his heart, and made him feel anything but the tramp
laborer that he actually was. He smiled now at his frankness
in telling Madge that he had come West seeking her,
and wondered where he had found the courage. It was
plain that she had suspected why he had come; she must
have realized that coincidence had not set him down in a
camp next door to hers. And she had asked the meaning
of it. Had she expected the brave reply that he had made?
Joshua whistled as he followed the well-beaten footpath
that ran parallel with the new railroad grade. He was well
satisfied with the result of his renewed friendship with the
Mundys. Physically Madge was even more glorious than
he had expected her to be, but he grew a trifle morose when
he remembered her reference to money-making. Joshua
was too much of a dreamer, too thoroughly wrapped up in
the romance of astronomy, to give great heed to money
matters. And he wanted the woman he was going to love—Madge,
in short—to be as indifferent to the moron idea
of slaving day and night for riches as he was. But Madge
would be all right—he was too young, too full of youth’s
enthusiasm over life in general to beckon difficulties. And
if they came uncalled he would surmount them. Yes,
Madge was all right—more than all right.</p>

<p>He returned to his block-hole drilling the following
morning, and nothing out of the ordinary occurred until
the ghost walked. Then, with his pay in his pocket, he
trudged around the lake to Ragtown, a new tent village
which had sprung into being since the establishment of
Demarest, Spruce and Tillou’s Camp Number One, and sent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
a money-order to his brother. His letter asked that all of
his belongings be expressed to him immediately. Then he
sent money to three magazines devoted to the science of
astronomy, and returned to his muscle-building hammerwork
once more.</p>

<p>He wanted to call on the Mundys the following Sunday,
but refrained. It would not do to presume too far on their
friendship. Yet he longed desperately to see Madge again.
He wondered about young Montgomery. What was he
like? Madge had not mentioned him; Joshua knew only
that California Bill had referred to him as one of the
ardent suitors of the shanty queen.</p>

<p>California Bill arrived in camp in the course of a day or
two, and that night Joshua saw him for the first time since
his trip down the line. They sat on the ground at the edge
of camp and watched the lake turn red, then violet, then
purple as the sun sank to rest behind Saddle Mountain;
and Bill, as he listened to Joshua’s accusation, sang softly:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“My head likes liquor, but my stomach don’t.</div>
<div class="verse">My feet cut up, but my stomach won’t.</div>
<div class="verse">My hands play poker and my tongue sings a song,</div>
<div class="verse">But my stomach keeps a-sayin’, ‘There’s somethin’ wrong.’</div>
</div></div>

<p>“But what’re ye kickin’ about?” he broke off. “Wanted
to see her, didn’t ye? Well, I told her all about ye, an’
she said she’d ride up next day an’ see ye. I knew ye
wouldn’t look her up short of a month, an’ by that time
maybe Jack Montgomery’d have her dead to rights. Now
she’s seen ye, though, she’ll think a while before lettin’
Montgomery run away with her. What she have to say
about yer astronomy, Tony?”</p>

<p>“Why, are you so greatly interested in my astronomy?”
asked Joshua.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>“Certainly am. Thing like that always takes on me.
Now, if ye had a project in mind to make a million or two
I wouldn’t give ye a smile. But somethin’ reg’lar, like
astronomy, an’ I’m out to help. Did ye send f’r yer traps
back East come payday?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ve sent for them,” said Joshua. “And I’ve subscribed
for three scientific magazines, too. I’ll get to work
evenings as soon as my things come. It’ll take a lot of
study to bring me up to where I was when I left the House
of Refuge.”</p>

<p>Then he told Bill about the little cave that he had discovered,
where he could hide himself away and find quiet
for his work. And this disclosure led to the one concerning
the miniature mountain beyond the lake, where the
atmosphere seemed so rare.</p>

<p>“By golly!” Bill applauded. “That’ll be just the place,
Tony. We’ll fix ye up there all snug an’ tight, when ye get
that telescope made, an’ ye’ll become an institution in the
mountains—a character, ye know, like me. Tony of Telescope
Mountain, they’ll be callin’ ye. No, that there don’t
sound just right—seems. Le’me think! Spyglass sounds
more romantic than Telescope, don’t it? Tony of Spyglass— No,
by golly, I got it! Cole of Spyglass Mountain! That’s
the dope. An’ say—why didn’t I think of it before, Tony?
Just the caper. C’mon to my bunk tent with me—I got
somethin’ to show ye.”</p>

<p>When they reached the big tent in which California Bill
slept during his short periods in the mountain camp, where
men lay in bunks three tiers high and talked or read, Bill
reached under his straw pillow and pulled out a newspaper.
He carried it to where the light of a candle, fused with its
own drippings to the lid of a can, threw a feeble radiance
over one end of the tent. He found what he wished to show
his friend and handed him the paper. He rolled a cigarette<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
and watched Joshua from under bushy black brows
as he read.</p>

<p>When Joshua looked up from the article California Bill
winked knowingly and laid a finger on his lips. Then,
pocketing the paper, he led the way out again.</p>

<p>“Well, how’s it strike ye, Tony?” he asked as they
walked through the trees once more.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe I understood all of it,” was Joshua’s
reply.</p>

<p>“It’s jest like this here,” said Bill. “All o’ this land
about the lake here, an’ f’r God knows how many miles
beyond, is in the forest reserve. It ain’t been used f’r
anythin’ but the delight o’ hunters an’ the fattenin’ of Ole
Lee Sweet’s cows f’r a few months in the summer. Lee
he owns Box-R Ranch, down on the desert, where we camped
first night outa Spur. Them’s his cattle ye see roamin’
’round the lake. Well, now along comes the gover’ment—seems—an’
says this here land’s good f’r somethin’ else.
It c’n raise things besides sagebrush and blue-weed and
saltgrass, an’ it ain’t the gover’ment’s purpose to let good
land go to waste. So they’re goin’ to throw her open to
homestead entry pretty soon.</p>

<p>“I remember myself when the gover’ment surveyors was
up in here last year, runnin’ lines, but I never paid any
attention. Had a lot o’ State University boys with ’em, an’
I thought they was jest practicin’, maybe, or reëstablishin’
the lines of an old survey that was made here forty years
ago. Anyway, they was separatin’ the agricultural land
from the worthless parts—seems—an’ now it’s out that a
fella c’n take up a homestead here.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, I read that there account in Spur, an’ f’r
some reason er other I tucked the paper under my wagon
seat. Thought f’r a little, I guess, that maybe I’d take
up a piece f’r myself an’ settle down an’ quit my foolin’,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
but I’d forgot all about it until ye tells me about Spyglass
Mountain. Tony, what ye wanta do is this: Ye wanta go
to work an’ get down to Los Angeles an’ file a homestead
claim as close as ye c’n get to Spyglass Mountain. Maybe
the lines run beyond the mountain, because pretty good
land runs right clost to the foot o’ the slope. Then ye c’n
have yer own mountain right on yer prop’ty. Now that
the railroad’s comin’ through this country, it won’t be no
time before every acre o’ that land’s took up. There can’t
be much of it. Ye gotta act quick. Tell ye what we’ll do.
Le’me think a minute.</p>

<p>“Yes, tell ye what we’ll do: You lay off to-morrow, an’
when I go out I’ll drive clean ’round the lake with ye an’
take ye to G-string. There’s an <i>hombre</i> there I know—name
o’ Golden. He’s a mining engineer, but I reckon he
knows about surveys, too. Course he will! Well, we’ll
get this Golden an’ have ’im go with ye an’ make location
on the land ye’ll want. Take a hundred an’ sixty—all
ye c’n get. Then I’ll have to be drivin’ on to Spur right
away. But you c’n come on down on the stage next day,
an’ beat it to Los Angeles to make yer filin’. Got any
jack?”</p>

<p>“Not much,” answered Joshua, catching Bill’s enthusiasm.
“Scientific magazines are expensive, and—”</p>

<p>“Well, I got about forty bones I c’n loan ye. Guess
it’ll cost ye somethin’ over twenty-five for yer filin’ fee,
an’ ye won’t have much to blow on peanuts. But ye’ll
make it all right. Yes, sir, that’s jest what you’n’me’ll
do, Tony. An’ maybe later on I c’n pick me out a piece
f’r myself.”</p>

<p>“Look here, California,” said Joshua, laying a firm hand
on his friend’s shoulder, “do you want a piece of that
land?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>“Naw,” scoffed Bill. “Jest kiddin’ myself. What’d I
do with a farm?”</p>

<p>“I believe,” said Joshua, “that you do want a piece, and
that if you had more money you’d go with me and make a
filing too.”</p>

<p>“Ferget it! No such thing. I was jest kiddin’.”</p>

<p>“Bill!”</p>

<p>“Honest to God, Tony! Why, I’ll be drivin’ hosses all
my life—seems. Couldn’t do anythin’ else if I wanted to.
Shut up now. G’wan an’ tell yer boss ye’re layin’ off a
day or two, an’ then go to bed. I’ll see ye in the mornin’.
Cole of Spyglass Mountain—that’s the stuff!”</p>

<p>There came a severe tickling in Joshua’s throat when he
tried to raise further protest against the old man’s generosity,
but Bill grabbed him by the arm and turned him
about. Then, administering a light kick, he bade him to
“shut up an’ hit the hay,” and Joshua, too hopefully
elated to refuse good fortune when it came his way, hurried
into camp and to the walking boss.</p>

<p>Next morning he rode around the lake with California
Bill toward G-string, his body on the high seat over the
rolling backs of Bill’s slick mules, his soul sailing in the
heavens.</p>

<small>A TRIO OF SHOCKS</small></h2>

<p class="drop-cap">MR. JOHN GOLDEN, mining engineer at G-string,
readily consented to help Joshua Cole for the sake
of his friendship with California Bill. Nor did
he ask anything for his trouble and experience, for such is
the custom among friends who live in the free and generous
outlands. Bill would have helped him build a stable or a
house, had he required such aid, and would have been offended
if he had offered pay. So now he helped Bill’s
friend.</p>

<p>California Bill drove on to Spur after leaving the two
in the vicinity of the newly named Spyglass Mountain.
Joshua and Golden spent the entire day searching for the
stakes of the recent survey and running lines. They discovered
that only a part of Spyglass Mountain was covered
by the survey, and the portion that had been included was
within the limits simply because it had been impracticable
to leave it out.</p>

<p>But this did not down Joshua’s ardor. The hundred and
sixty acres finally settled upon lay at the foot of the steep
rise, and a great deal of the land beyond it, on the desert
side, would be in the forest reserve. It would therefore
be open to his use, and it might be, even, that he could
obtain a special permit from the forest service to build
an observatory on the mountain’s top. So California
Bill had encouraged him, anyway, and Bill knew much
about the workings of the government offices that control
the forest privileges of homesteaders and cattlemen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>So with the legal description of the desired land in his
pocket, Joshua walked to Ragtown early next morning and
took the stage to Spur. That evening he reached Los
Angeles by train, and was on hand at the Federal Building
next morning when the land office was opened.</p>

<p>He found the land office people unwilling to aid him
beyond showing him a formidable-looking book wherein
the land was listed. Unfamiliar with such procedures, he
wrestled with the big book for an hour, then gave it up,
secured an application blank, filled in the data, and passed
it to a clerk. It was taken in to the commissioner, presumably,
and presently he was called inside, where the fee
was extracted from him. He was told that he would be
notified by letter whether or not his claim would be allowed,
and that if it was not allowed his money would be returned
to him. This seemed to be all that was required of him, so
he took his leave, in the dark as to whether or not his mission
had been a success.</p>

<p>He had money left. He remembered what it would be
necessary for him to buy in the way of materials for the
building of his proposed telescope. So in order to forestall
another trip to Los Angeles, he bought a seventy-inch
piece of brass tubing, a small plano-convex lens about an
inch in diameter, a few smaller pieces of tubing, a hand
magnifying glass, and an ordinary camera tripod. And
now there remained only five dollars and some odd cents
of the money that both he and California Bill had saved
from their first payday with Demarest, Spruce and Tillou.
However, he had his return ticket to Spur and enough for
stage fare back to Ragtown, but he could not buy a meal.
Oh, well—hunger was no new thing to him. He could eat
when he reached camp again, to-morrow night! He would
be a poor servant of Science if he could not sacrifice four
meals in her cause.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>Shortly before dark the following evening the stage
topped the summit of the mountains and rattled down the
steep grade toward Stirrup Lake. Joshua still had four
miles to walk after reaching Ragtown, and he wondered if
he could persuade one of the cooks or flunkies to give him
a hand-out. The stage reached the level of the lake and
made speed around the eastern end toward Ragtown, whose
lights blinked out with subtle invitation.</p>

<p>Ragtown was such a mushroom growth as springs up in
wilderness localities wherever big construction is taking
place. Like Wild Woman Springs, it was composed of new
pine-shacks and tents. There is always a “rag town”
close to a big railroad-building job, so called because of
its tents, but this one had not chosen a name to distinguish
it, so it was Ragtown to the thousands of laborers traveling
up and down the line. It was a riotous place, of course, the
scene of many drunken brawls and wild nights of carousal,
but it was typical of the pioneering West, sinful but picturesquely
sinful.</p>

<p>The tent saloons and dance halls were filled to overflowing
as the stage wheeled to a stop before The Silver
Dollar, in which was the store and post office, hypocritically
partitioned off with thin boards from the bar and
dance hall, with a convenient archway between. A hundred
men, perhaps, were in the one street that extended
through the town, and a dozen saddle horses were tied to a
hitching rack, proving that the Box-R cowpunchers were
making the most of this spark of civilization that had flared
up over night.</p>

<p>Joshua climbed out of the stage, his heavy bundle under
his arm. He had no money to buy food or entertainment
at Ragtown, so without a look to right or left he started
up the street, which was no more than an inhabited portion
of the long road from Spur to the railroad grade. He saw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
a knot of men standing in front of The Golden Eagle, a
saloon, restaurant, gambling den, and dance hall, next door
to The Silver Dollar, and as he passed them he glanced at
the object that held their interest. Just then a spectator
swung away from the group, and Joshua saw a man seated
on the beaten ground beside the road—there was no sidewalk—and
before him a black cloth was spread, on which
two skeletons five inches high danced weirdly.</p>

<p>It was the old game of The Whimperer, but Joshua was
surprised to see anybody trying it here. He stepped closer
and through the half-light looked at the operator’s face.
The black hat was pulled down over the man’s eyes, but
there was no mistaking the evil-looking scar that glared out
from its surrounding patch of stubby beard.</p>

<p>The master of the skeleton dance was Joshua’s jocker,
the man who had robbed him of his dearest treasure, The
Whimperer.</p>

<p>For a little Joshua saw red, as thoughts came to him of
all the misery that this tramp’s treachery had brought
upon him. Next instant he had dropped his bundle and
was elbowing men aside as he marched to the squatting
panhandler.</p>

<p>“Well, Whimp,” he said in tones that trembled slightly,
“where’s my telescope?”</p>

<p>The skeletons ceased their dance and toppled over. For
two tense seconds the old John Yegg stared up at Joshua,
his ugly mouth open. Then he made the quickest move
that Joshua had ever seen him make, for with a squirming
jump he had flipped himself to his feet and was fleeing down
the street.</p>

<p>Joshua pursued, his youthful heart afire with the lust to
mete out punishment for a great wrong done him. The
Whimperer darted between two tents as Joshua closed in
on him, then whipped to the left and was out of sight when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
Joshua reached the rear. But ahead a tent swayed back
and forth, as if some one had entered it violently and collided
with one of the poles. Toward it Joshua darted,
flung back the flaps, and looked inside.</p>

<p>There came a guttural howl, and The Whimperer threw
himself flat on the hard earth and wriggled under the rear
wall of the tent. But Joshua did not pursue him. He
stood stock-still in the entrance, gazing in unbelief at a
man who sat at a rude table, on which was a lighted candle
in a beer bottle, and stared back at him, half risen from
his chair, motionless.</p>

<p>And this man was Felix Wolfgang, lean and sandy-haired
and freckled as the egg of a guinea hen—Number
Twenty-three forty-four in the House of Refuge.</p>

<p>Joshua was the first to recover from the shock. His
tense muscles relaxed and his surprise found voice.</p>

<p>“Say, am I off my nut, or are you Number Twenty-three
forty-four? It’s one of the two—that’s certain.”</p>

<p>Slim Wolfgang settled back into his seat and a sickly
smile played on his lips.</p>

<p>“Youse ain’t nuts, I guess,” he croaked half moodily.
“I’m Slim Wolfgang, all right—Number Twenty-three
forty-four. An’ youse’re ole Tony. I’d know youse any
place. How’s ever’t’ing, Tony?”</p>

<p>“What in the dickens are you doing here?” Joshua took
several steps into the tent, but did not offer his hand when
he reached Wolfgang’s side.</p>

<p>“An’ I might ast de same of youse, ol’-timer,” Wolfgang
retorted, rolling a cigarette and letting it drip from his
lower lip when lighted.</p>

<p>“That’s quickly told. I’m working as a hammerman for
Demarest, Spruce and Tillou.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m runnin’ a stud game in De Golden Eagle,”
Slim stated in his husky tones. “An’ I just drifted in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
here because I hoid dere was good pickin’s among de construction
stiffs. I been runnin’ stud layouts fer sev’ral
years out West.”</p>

<p>Joshua pondered over this. Slim’s explanation seemed
logical enough; and, but for the fact that The Whimperer
had scurried through that tent, Joshua would have considered
this one of those strange chance meetings that occur
in the lives of men who travel far from home.</p>

<p>“But that tramp,” he questioned—“how does it come
that he ducked through here when I chased him? Do you
know him?”</p>

<p>“Who—dat geed-up guy? Yes, I seen um about here a
little since I come. Dat was yesterday. But I don’t exactly
know um. Was youse chasin’ um, Tony? Wot for? He
comes bulgin’ in here an’ pretty near knocked de old rag
flat. I’m buckin’ solitaire—see?” Slim indicated a spread
of playing cards on the table. “An’ before I c’n get outa
me chair to fin’ out wot’s doin’, youse show up an’ dat
yegg frogs it unner de back wall o’ de tent an’ beats it.
Wot’s it all about, Tony?”</p>

<p>Joshua did not answer the question. It struck him as
the strangest coincidence imaginable that, away out here
in Ragtown, six thousand feet above the sea, he should meet
the man who had robbed him in the Middle West and chase
him through the tent of his old enemy in the House of
Refuge.</p>

<p>“And you say you don’t actually know this fellow?”</p>

<p>“Naw—jes’ seen um hangin’ aroun’. He’s a stiff—dey
folly big construction, don’t dey? Maybe de likes o’ dis
plug don’t woik much, but dey hang aroun’ an’ help de
busy little bees spend dere payday. I don’t know nuttin’
about um. W’y’re youse astin’ me?”</p>

<p>This dialogue was bringing Joshua no information whatever,
and it had caused him to lose track of The Whimperer,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
who by now was without doubt securely hidden.
Joshua turned about and started for the entrance to the
tent.</p>

<p>“Ain’t sore, are youse, Fifty-six thirty-five?”—from
Slim.</p>

<p>Joshua turned at the door. “No, not at all,” he replied,
regarding Wolfgang studiously. “In fact, I made a
fool out of myself by chasing The Whimperer, and now I’m
going home and forget it. Good-night.”</p>

<p>“I see youse don’ wanta renew de old acquaintance,
Tony,” said Wolfgang, “so we’ll let ’er go at dat. But
if youse feel like a little stud any time, drop into De Golden
Eagle. Me game’s clean, an’ if youse win youse’ll get away
wid it. I ain’t got no hard feelin’s, Fifty-six thirty-five.
Wot we did as kids don’ count f’r nuttin’ now. We was
bot’ nutty den, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Call me Tony, if you want to,” Joshua offered, “but cut
out the Fifty-six thirty-five, will you, please?”</p>

<p>“Don’ like to remember, eh, Tony?”</p>

<p>“It’s just as well not to.”</p>

<p>“I guess youse’re right at dat. Maybe youse don’ want
dese plugs aroun’ here to savvy dat youse was in de House
o’ Refuge.”</p>

<p>“There’s no call to advertise it,” Joshua told him. “I
was committed unjustly, and—”</p>

<p>“Dat’s wot dey all said, Tony.”</p>

<p>“Well, anyway, it’s more convenient to say ‘Tony’ than
‘Fifty-six thirty-five.’ Good-night.”</p>

<p>“S’long, Tony. Don’ forget de number.”</p>

<p>The tent flaps fell behind Joshua, and he hurried back
to the street to recover his abandoned bundle.</p>

<p>He found it kicked to one side against the front of The
Silver Dollar, shouldered it, and set off through the night
toward camp, utterly amazed at what had taken place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>But a new shock awaited him there. One of the cook’s
flunkies, whom he persuaded to go to the cook tent and set
out some cold food for him, told him while he ate that
Shanty Madge’s boss-powderman, Jawbone Mahoney, had
gone on the job intoxicated and had fired a big shot, with
the result that the wet, crumbly top of the big hill was
sliding into the tunnel and that all efforts at stopping it
had been of no avail. Shanty Madge, the old-time stiffs
were gossiping, was ruined.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX<br>

<small>“A LITTLE SLEEP”</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">SINCE Joshua Cole already was on vacation, he decided
to extend his absence from work for one more
day and hurry in the morning to Madge and her
mother. He would at least be able to voice his sympathy
over the catastrophe, though he realized this would help
matters not at all.</p>

<p>Directly after breakfast he set out afoot, and covered the
distance between the camps in a little over an hour. Mrs.
Mundy he found in their home tent, but Madge was up at
the works.</p>

<p>“I felt that it was coming, Joshua,” Elizabeth Mundy
said wearily. “They say Demarest, Spruce and Tillou will
have to take over our outfit in the end in payment for the
help and materials they will have to supply us with to
clear the tunnel. We haven’t much besides the outfit—that
is, in the way of cash. If they are obliged to come
to our aid we’re lost. You see, it will be just as if we were
put on force account by the railroad company. When it
becomes apparent that a contractor working directly for the
railroad company—as are Demarest, Spruce and Tillou—is
not going to make good on his contract, the company puts
his outfit on force account. That means that the owner
and his outfit are virtually hired by the day to do the work.
He receives so much for each team, so much for each man’s
wages, and so much for his own salary. And in the end, if
he fails under this procedure, he is obliged to forfeit everything.
With us, since we are sub-contracting from Demarest,
Spruce and Tillou, we are responsible to them rather<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
than directly to the company. So it will be they who will
take everything from us if we can’t fulfill our contract.
They’re nice gentlemen—all of them—but friendship won’t—mustn’t—stand
in the way of their fulfilling what they
have contracted to do. Poor Madge! She’s nearly distracted.”</p>

<p>“Is the situation entirely hopeless?” asked Joshua.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid so.”</p>

<p>They talked for an hour before Joshua left to go to the
tunnel, and in the course of their conversation he told her
of his prospective homestead.</p>

<p>“Joshua,” she said, “I’m going to tell you something
that you mustn’t tell Madge. You’ll be astonished to know
that, if we fail and lose the outfit, I shall be glad. I don’t
want my daughter to follow railroad construction as her
life’s work. I suppose I’m selfish and old-fashioned, but
I can’t bring myself to feel that a girl was brought into
this world to do work like that. So far as the outdoor life
is concerned, I am delighted with that phase of railroading.
But I’d prefer to be on a farm somewhere—or a ranch here
in the West—and live a simpler life. Madge would like
it too if she could be convinced that she was not deserting
the ship by giving up contracting. She wants to carry on
the work started by her father, who was just gaining a
good foothold when he died. That is a pretty sentiment,
but it is all wrong. If Madge were his son it would be a
different matter. But I’m tiring you—and I know you
understand my feelings. If only we could have one of
those homesteads—that’s what I’m trying to work up to.
Then Madge could still work off her surplus energy with
implements and horses, which seems to be her delight. She
would be right at home, and we would be free of forever
running over the United States, from job to job. But she
never would consent.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>Joshua remained thoughtful for a time before he said:
“Why wouldn’t it be a good idea, Mrs. Mundy, for you to
file on one of the claims without letting Madge know anything
about it? Then if she fails on the job and loses the
outfit, you’ll have something to fall back on. You won’t
be required by the government to establish residence on the
land until six months after you have filed. That would
give you plenty of time to find out whether or not you are
to lose everything. And if you do lose, you could surprise
Madge and raise her spirits immeasurably. There would be
something left, I imagine—some money and stock and tools
to work your claim with?”</p>

<p>“Yes, they scarcely would be able to strip us down to
nothing—especially if we get out early. Joshua, I think
you have given me good advice. Will you help me?”</p>

<p>“I’ll do anything I can, Mrs. Mundy.”</p>

<p>“Then if I can get out of the mountains for a few days
without Madge suspecting that I have designs on her
future, can you see me in Los Angeles and show me how
to proceed?”</p>

<p>“First,” Joshua told her, “you will have to pick out
your land. But that’s easy, and I can attend to it for you.
The land that is to be thrown open lies in a semi-circular
strip about the lake, and nearly every hundred-and-sixty
extends out into the water. Mine doesn’t, for I chose the
piece nearest to what California Bill has christened Spyglass
Mountain. Mine is perhaps the poorest of all for agricultural
purposes, but it’s just what I want. But what I’m
trying to get at is that there is little choice, from a farming
standpoint, among any of the hundred-and-sixties offered.
So why not take the claim next to mine? It has as
many trees on it as any of the rest, and is as picturesque in
every detail. It extends out into the lake, so that you are
always assured of a supply of water. If you’ll let me decide<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
for you, I can give you the legal description right now.
It will be easy to figure out since it adjoins mine. Then we
can—”</p>

<p>Here Joshua paused and looked uncomfortable. “Well,
I’ll have to be frank,” he said. “I can’t go to Los Angeles
with you because I haven’t the money.”</p>

<p>“Don’t look so miserable about it, Joshua,” she laughed.
“Why, we’ve been flat broke a hundred times, and know
all about it. Would you let me pay your expenses?”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t like to.”</p>

<p>“If I were a man you’d consent readily, since it is
purely a business matter and there would be no reason
whatever why you should give me your services free. Be
sensible, Joshua.”</p>

<p>“Why not go alone and look up a land lawyer in the
city?” he suggested. “He could give you better service
than I can, and it probably would cost you less. That’s
just the thing to do, it seems to me. You’ll be able to
find the advertisement of one of these fellows in the
liners section of any Los Angeles paper. I’ll give you
the legal description at once. You’ll have no difficulty
at all.”</p>

<p>“That does sound easy,” she agreed. “Give me the data,
then, please, and I’ll have myself driven to Ragtown to-morrow
morning and take the stage out of the mountains.
Madge will think I’m deserting her in her hour of trouble,
but I’ll plead sickness and strain and tell her I’m going
to a friend of ours in the city for a day or two. Will the
deception be justifiable, Joshua?”</p>

<p>“I’ll shrive you,” he smiled.</p>

<p>“Then we have a secret between us, Joshua. Not a hint
to Madge, now!”</p>

<p>Joshua crossed his heart and “hoped to die,” and Elizabeth
Mundy laughed like a girl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>“You’ve given me a new heart, my boy,” she said. “I
feel a different woman since you came.”</p>

<p>“You must remember,” he warned, “that there is the
possibility of our claims being rejected by the land office.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! Not a chance in the world, Joshua. Fate
could not be so unkind as that. Go on with your gloominess—go
see Madge and cheer her up, while I pack my
suitcase. A woman has to have at least a full day to pack
for a three-days’ trip, you know.”</p>

<p>Work was in full swing when Joshua reached the mouth
of the tunnel—but what a waste of energy! For fifty
feet the walls and roof of the tunnel presented solid rock,
then one reached the spot where Jawbone’s fatal shot had
been fired. Here the roof and the timbers had been unable
to stand the shock, and had given way. And the top of
the mountain was literally sliding into the tunnel. Every
cartload that was hauled away made room for another cartload
to slide down in its place; and it was plain to be
seen that, if no way was found to stop the gap, the entire
top of the hill must be carried out through the tunnel’s
mouth.</p>

<p>Madge was in the tunnel. With her were Demarest and
Tillou and three engineers. Up on the hilltop, where the
mud springs and magnesia waters gushed, were more engineers,
studying the trend of the slide.</p>

<p>“Hello, Joshua!” Madge called as she saw him entering
with his candle over his head. “You’ll have to excuse me
to-day. I’m not at home. But it was kind of you to
come. Just make yourself at home, and I’ll talk to you at
dinnertime.”</p>

<p>Her tone was a brave attempt at cheerfulness, but even
in the dim light cast by the candles in the tunnel Joshua
noted the tired look about her eyes and the slight sag of
her lower lip, which told him that she was about all in. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
watched the men at work for a time, then went out and
clambered to the hilltop.</p>

<p>The engineers foregathered here, lean brown men in neat
outing suits and trim puttees, paid no heed to the man in
overalls who went about looking over the ground. They
were talking among themselves, and they all looked wise
and dictatorial. Moseying here and there, Joshua studied
the slide, and at last stepped close enough to overhear the
conversation of the engineers.</p>

<p>“There’s only one way to go about it, I’m telling you,”
he heard. “I saw a similar situation on the Denver and
Rio Grande, when I was with old La Salle. There they
hauled in hundreds of tons of baled hay and chucked it
into the gap. And it held the slide back till they could
timber up again and work beyond the hole in the roof. Now
here it’s simpler than that. Baled hay costs money, but
we’ve got a heavy forest all around us. It won’t take any
time at all for a good timber crew to fell enough trees to
stop that slide. In a week’s time everything will be moving
along as before. Let’s put it up to the boss. I tell you I
know she’ll work like a charm.”</p>

<p>“Provided,” thought Joshua, “that what remains of the
tunnel’s roof will continue to stand the strain when they
begin firing again.”</p>

<p>He did not see Madge again until noon, when he ate with
her and her mother in their living tent. Usually Mrs.
Mundy and her daughter dined with what is known in
construction circles as “the royal family,” which consists
of the contractors and their families, the walking boss, the
commissary men and bookkeepers—almost every one in
camp holding a position above that of common laborer. But
to-day Joshua declined to eat with Mr. Demarest and Mr.
Tillou, who were guests of the camp, in order to avoid a
possible embarrassing situation. So Madge made excuses to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
her guests for herself and her mother, and ordered dinner
for three served in the living tent.</p>

<p>Madge was quiet and thoughtful, with little lines of
worriment at the corners of her mouth and eyes. Still,
she was hopeful, for the young engineers had told her the
essence of what Joshua had heard on the hilltop.</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll pull out of it, all right,” she strove to assure
herself.</p>

<p>Joshua said nothing to this. He was thinking deeply.
He was afraid that, after the gap had been stopped with
tree trunks, as soon as another shot was fired, no matter
how light it might be, another cave-in would occur, and
they would find themselves back where they started. But
he said nothing of this to Madge, and tried to interest her
in his homestead to take her mind from her worries.</p>

<p>He bade the mother and daughter good-by in the middle
of the afternoon and returned to his own camp. Next
morning he was swinging a hammer again in his old place,
his mind full of many things.</p>

<p>A month passed, during which time he was unable to
visit the Mundys again. He worked all day, and at night
he wrestled with the problem of making his telescope in
the blacksmith shop. His express shipment had long since
arrived at Ragtown, and he had his notes to aid him, but
he soon found out that it is easier to tell one how to make
things than to actually do the work.</p>

<p>In that month he frequently heard gossip as to the situation
at the camp of the Mundys. Slide after slide was
taking place, though the forest about the camp was being
denuded of its magnificent trees in an effort to stem the
tide. A famous engineer from the East had been summoned,
and he was on the job at an enormous salary; but
still the rotten stone and mud continued to slide into the
tunnel. And now, it was said, it was coming from three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
directions. Then the buzz went through camp that Demarest,
Spruce and Tillou had offered twenty-five hundred
dollars to the man who could stop that slide, regardless of
the expense.</p>

<p>“Bluenose,” said Joshua to his fellow-workman when the
foregoing report had been confirmed, “I’m going down
there and figure out a way to stop that slide. I’ve one
grand little idea in my head. I would have suggested it
before, but thought I’d be butting in and couldn’t attract
anybody’s attention—least of all the attention of those big
engineers. But now it’s open to anybody, and I’m going
down to-night. But keep it dark, will you? I don’t want
to make a monkey out of myself until I’ve looked over the
ground again.”</p>

<p>“Say, kid,” was Bluenose’s encouraging remark, “you’re
absolutely nuts! <i>You</i> stop that slide, when Emanuel Peters,
one o’ th’ highest-paid engineers in the U. S. A., can’t cut
th’ riffle! Gaw wan! Come outa yer pipe dream, ol’-timer.
That offer ain’t meant for a stiff. It’s for old railroaders
who know their job. What d’you know about engineerin’?”</p>

<p>“Nothing,” admitted Joshua. “And more than that, I
have no head at all for figures. But I’ve got one asset,
Bluenose, and I think it may win out for me. The trouble
with these big engineers, it seems to me, may be that they’re
too theoretical. They figure things out by rules and formulas.
Why, in school we had a boy who could work
almost any problem in mathematics, and he got his results
with a method all his own. He never worked out a problem
as it was supposed to be worked out, but he got correct
answers every time. He used what I’m going to use down
there at that slide.”</p>

<p>“What’d he use?” growled the unconvinced Bluenose.</p>

<p>“Horse sense,” said Joshua.</p>

<p>“You’re a goof,” Bluenose told him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>It was still quite light when Joshua set off after supper
for the Mundys’ camp. He followed the trail that many
feet had trod along the right-of-way, through darkening
forest and grassy meadows. He was deep in his plans, walking
with his eyes on the ground, when suddenly from the
trees on his left, came the echoing bark of a rifle.</p>

<p>It startled him, and somehow he felt queer and weak.
Then such pain as he never before had felt gripped his
entire body, it seemed, and the forest began to rise and
float off toward the clouds. There came another shot, but
it seemed far away. Joshua sank slowly to his knees, then
felt like lying down to sleep. He did not fall, but lowered
both hands to the ground and eased himself down into a
comfortable position. He knew that a stream of warm
blood was running down his arm, but he did not mind.
All he wanted was a little sleep, and then he would be
going on to the Mundys. Ten minutes sleep—and then he
would hurry on to Shanty Madge!</p>

<small>THE SURRENDER</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">JOSHUA COLE recovered consciousness in the railroad
hospital at Ragtown, and stared blankly at a
streak of light that came in between the new pine
boards of the walls and pointed out a resinous knothole in
the floor. The shack which bore the dignified name of hospital
was on the outskirts of the settlement, a two-room
affair that, if it had been a little more expensively constructed,
would have served well as a stable for mountain
horses, who do not need shelter except when rare blizzards
rage. Each workman on the entire job contracted for by
Demarest, Spruce and Tillou had a dollar of his pay subtracted
each month whether he approved or not, and this
was his hospital fee. It assured him of medical attention
without other charges if he became ill. There were perhaps
fifteen hundred men working directly or indirectly under
Demarest, Spruce and Tillou. That made fifteen hundred
dollars to be divided between the doctor and the main contractors,
the latter, of course, being entitled to something
for permitting the doctor to conduct the hospital. And
Joshua Cole was the fifth man to be sent to the hospital
since it had been established. No wonder that Dr. J. Miles
Stanhope had much leisure and much money to spend in
the Silver Dollar, where his preferences were roulette, and
whisky with a dash of angostura bitters, and a blonde
Jezebel named Gladys, who waltzed rather well.</p>

<p>He was at his favorite haunt, it appeared, when his
patient awoke, for Joshua not knowing where he was,
called feebly again and again, but received no answer. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
strove to get out of the single white-enamel iron bed in
which he found himself, but discovered that he was sore all
over and rather weak. His efforts had made him sleepy,
and he sank back on the pillow and floated into coma again.</p>

<p>When he awoke the second time night had fallen, for no
sunlight streamed in at the crack where the loose batten
hung. Lamplight, however, came in through the quarter-way-open
door between his “ward” and the dispensary, or
whatever the other room was called. He lifted his voice
again, and was answered by a shuffle of feet.</p>

<p>In came Dr. J. Miles Stanhope, and one of the frames of
the door showed an inclination to come with him. The
doc righted himself, however, and swayed toward his patient,
his face beaming with solicitude.</p>

<p>Dr. J. Miles Stanhope was a young man inclined to
corpulency. He affected a Van Dyke beard, as all medical
men should. His gray eyes were kindly and he could not
have injured a mouse—nor could he have cured one. But
he was a jolly good fellow and wished nobody ill. Who
couldn’t be like that, with a monthly income of over a
thousand dollars from a two-hundred-dollar investment?—and
the doc had kicked like a bay steer when the carpenters
presented their bill for the erection of the hospital. It
might be pointed out that the time and money spent by
the doctor in acquiring his medical education would bring
his investment to a higher figure, but as he displayed no
diploma from a medical college on the wall, it may be assumed
that he considered the price of a diploma too insignificant
to be taken into consideration.</p>

<p>At any rate, here he was at Joshua’s bedside, good-natured,
democratic, breezily cheerful, and a trifle shaky
on his feet.</p>

<p>“Well, well, well! So you’re conscious, eh? Thash th’
stuff, ol’-timer! How d’ye feel by now?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>“I’m sore as hell,” growled Joshua. “Where am I?
Who are you?”</p>

<p>The last question seemed to grieve Dr. J. Miles Stanhope,
and he reprovingly explained that he was the medical adviser
of the community, something that Joshua should have
known merely by glancing at his Van Dyke beard. As to
where Joshua was, he was in the hospital conducted by
the medical adviser of the community. And if he was sore,
there was good reason for it, since he had been shot to hell
with a thirty-thirty rifle. But he—the medical adviser of
the community—had found the bullet and extracted it, and
he was of the opinion that his patient was on the mend.
Did he want some chow? The Silver Dollar’s cook was out
of fresh meat, and the doctor supposed the rest of the joints
were in the same fix, since no freighters had arrived for
three days. But there was salt meat in plenty to be had,
storage eggs, bread, and oleomargarine. Concerning the
question of where Joshua had been shot, it was in the left
shoulder, very low, and well in toward the heart. The
doc had no idea who had shot him or why, and it seemed
that it had not occurred to anybody to investigate this
phase of the matter. Two stiffs walking up the grade from
Camp Two to Camp One had found him lying in the trail,
and, after appropriating two dollars found in his pockets
and his flannel shirt and belt—these facts were discovered
later—they had dutifully carried him to the hospital, had
called Dr. J. Miles Stanhope from the fondling arms of
Gladys, and had gone their way rejoicing. Now what about
the bacon and eggs?</p>

<p>Despite the bungling services of Dr. Stanhope, Joshua
Cole’s wound healed quickly, for he was in the pink of
health and a stranger to dissipation. While he was confined
to the little bed in the hospital, left alone for hours
on hours at a time, he was allowed to read and study, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
the doctor could not see that it would do him any harm.
“Just go ahead and amuse yourself any way you feel like,
ol’-timer,” was the medical man’s kind invitation; so
Joshua had sent for his books and notes, and with these
and his new periodicals to aid him, progressed rapidly at
bringing his astronomical information up to date.</p>

<p>He puzzled for hours, of course, over who had shot him,
and why. Naturally he thought often of The Whimperer
and Slim Wolfgang—the only people in that country who
could possibly have a grudge against him—but always he
discarded them as his possible assailants for the reason that
it seemed illogical they could harbor a hatred so fierce as
to make them try to murder him. After long contemplation,
he was forced to adopt the conclusion that some deer hunter
had shot him by accident and had fled and left him to his
fate rather than face the possible consequences.</p>

<p>Madge Mundy came to see him one afternoon, and apologized
for not coming sooner, pleading that she was almost
distracted over the grave matters in her camp and was kept
busy from morn till night.</p>

<p>She sat beside his bed and smoothed back his raven hair
with her soft, cool hand. Joshua was nearly well and suffering
not at all, but immediately he convinced himself that
he was very ill and needed these tender ministrations. His
gray-blue eyes looked up into her reddish-brown eyes pleadingly,
and Madge, too, believed that he needed these tender
ministrations. At any rate she continued them, and
Joshua lay with eyes closed, trembling with ecstasy, afraid
to look into her face again for fear that she would see
that he was in the seventh heaven of delight.</p>

<p>They talked of Shanty Madge’s problem, but with Joshua,
at least, the words, “slide” and “tunnel” and “dynamite”
were spoken with a caressing cadence that carried an undercurrent
of meaning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>“I guess all is lost,” Madge had told him when first the
subject was brought up.</p>

<p>And now she continued: “The entire top of the hill keeps
slipping in an easterly direction directly into the tunnel.
We are able to stop it with timbers and baled hay—which
last we are using now as likely to form a more solid wall
to hold the slide—but as soon as we attempt to go ahead
and fire a shot, no matter how light, the roof caves again,
and down comes another avalanche. Of course we are
working toward the slide from the other end of the tunnel,
too, and so far the roof holds there. But it’s a long tunnel,
and where we’re losing time is in not being able to progress
a foot with this end.</p>

<p>“Another big engineer has come from New York, and
he says nothing more can be done than has been done.
Everybody is up in the air. And—and, Joshua, I have
given up and turned the outfit over to Demarest, Spruce
and Tillou. I’m on salary now. I’m through. I know
when I’m whipped, and I must make the best of it. In the
end, of course, we’ll have to sign over everything to them,
and I guess they’re no more anxious than I am to continue
the heart-breaking work. That slide is like the heads of the
Hydra that Hercules slew. Its heads grew as fast as one
was lopped off, you know, until Hercules applied a firebrand
to prevent their growth. And I—I’m just through
forever with railroading, Joshua—that’s all. Joshua, we’ll
be broke.”</p>

<p>She was near to tears, and Joshua cursed the bullet that
had laid him in a bed in Dr. J. Miles Stanhope’s flimsy
hospital.</p>

<p>“Madge,” he said, “I’m going to tell you something;
though, if you are convinced, it will perhaps hurt you.
Maybe I’m the Hercules to apply the firebrand to your
nine-headed monster. I firmly believe that I could have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
stopped that slide when it first occurred. I believed so the
day I went to your camp and examined the top of the hill
and the tunnel. But there were big engineers on the job
as well as two old-time contractors, and I thought surely
they would find a way to solve the problem. Then when
days and days passed and nothing was accomplished I hated
to offer my services for fear I’d be laughed at and told to
mind my business. I’m only a construction stiff in the eyes
of those fellows, you know, and they would have put me in
my place in short order.</p>

<p>“But things looked different when Demarest offered
twenty-five hundred dollars to the man who could stop the
slide. Then it seemed to be open to anybody, and I was
on my way to your camp when I picked up this bullet. If
I had succeeded I would have felt wretched, to think that I
could have done the same at the first and had failed to
offer my services until the reward was announced. But I
guess you would have understood.</p>

<p>“Anyway, I still think that I may be able to hold the
thing. What it will cost to try my plan will be as nothing
compared with the money that is being expended now in
fruitless efforts. So, to make good with you, I’m going to
give you my plan right now, and you can put it up to the
engineers and see what they think of it. And the reward,
of course, will be yours. Will you see if you can find a
piece of paper and a pencil out in that lean-to that the
doctor calls his office and dispensary?”</p>

<p>“Joshua,” she said, “I will do nothing of the sort. Your
plan is yours, whatever it is, and, knowing you as I do, I
fully believe that it is worth something or you would not
consider it. In other words, boy, you convinced me years
ago, when you told me about the stars, that you are not
given to talking through your hat. I firmly believe”—she
forced a wan smile—“that—in how many centuries is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
it?—the big dipper will look like a steamer chair, simply
because you told me so. And now the reward for stopping
that famous slide has been raised to five thousand, and if
you can win it we’ll let her slide until you’re ready to
show us. That’s that!”</p>

<p>“But, Madge, listen to me. Take my plan now and, if
it works, stop the thing at once. A pile of money will
have been spent before I’m out of this confounded shack.
Take it, and save your outfit. Then if you care to split
the reward with me—”</p>

<p>“I’ll split nothing with you, young feller! Neither will
I take your plan and present it to anybody! And as for
losing the outfit, let her rip! I’m through—me! Trying
to stop the slide has cost so much that, even if we pulled
through, we’d be so badly in debt that it would require
years to get on our feet again. No, the outfit must go to
give us a clean slate, and we’ll let the future take care of
itself.</p>

<p>“I’ve been too cocksure—too swell-headed. And now I’m
being slapped on the wrist for my presumption in strutting
around with old-time railroaders, old enough to be my
grandfather, and talking wisely about this and that thing
about which I knew nothing. How they must have laughed
in their sleeves at me. Oh, it makes me sick now! I tell
you the past few weeks have taken all the pep and bravado
out of me. I’m whipped, and I’m through.</p>

<p>“And Ma tells me that you and she connived together
against me and got her a homestead here in the mountains.
Well, I’m glad. I’m for that. And I’m going to get out
while the gettin’s good, and save what I can of tools and
teams and cash to run the homestead with. Back to the
farm for little Madge!”</p>

<p>“But—”</p>

<p>“I tell you I’m through—stubbornly through, Joshua.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
I bit off a chunk and couldn’t swallow it. Now let’s drop
that aspect of the matter. When can you totter around,
does the doctor think?”</p>

<p>“Why, Doc doesn’t think at all, except when he’s over
the roulette wheel. I can go any time I myself think that
I can, and the sooner the better for him. It’s a great strain
for him to carry my meals to me three times a day. I guess
I’ll try it in about a week. I’ve been up four times, I
believe, and walked about a little. I won’t be able to work
myself, but I can put others to work. Three men will be
enough to put my idea across.”</p>

<p>“Then you get on the job as soon as you can and stop
that slide. You need the money.”</p>

<p>“I do,” fervently agreed Joshua. “But I’ll probably
never get it. I expect my big idea will prove a frost.”</p>

<p>“I’ll see that you get a chance to try it, anyway,” Madge
promised.</p>

<p>As she took her leave Dr. J. Miles Stanhope came in
with Joshua’s slim mail—a scientific magazine and a letter
from the land office. The letter informed him that his
claim to a hundred and sixty acres in the San Antonio
Mountains had been allowed.</p>

<small>HERCULES AND HIS FIREBRAND</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">TEN days after Shanty Madge visited Joshua Cole in
the hospital he left that highly efficient institution
and wended his slow way to Camp One. It was in
the morning. He at once inquired for Mr. Demarest, and
was told that he was at the Mundys’ Camp. Joshua was
obliged to wait until afternoon, when a freighter would be
traveling down the line, before continuing his journey to
the scene of the slide, for he dared not attempt such a walk
in his weakened condition.</p>

<p>He saw Bluenose and the other members of his crew and
asked if they would go to the camp of Shanty Madge and
work under his instructions, provided Demarest, Spruce
and Tillou gave consent. He wanted men whom he knew
and could in a measure place confidence in; and, though
they laughed at him, all three promised to go if called
upon.</p>

<p>At one o’clock in the afternoon the freighter set off, with
Joshua perched on the high seat beside him, and shortly
after two the passenger alighted and worked his slow way
up to the tunnel in search of Demarest or Spruce.</p>

<p>He found both contractors at the tunnel’s mouth, talking
with Shanty Madge and the engineers. The forest all
about the grade had been laid low by axmen, and the great
logs snaked into the tunnel in a vain effort to stem the tide
of rotten stone and slush. Thousands upon thousands of
dollars had been expended with no result, and in construction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
centers Shanty Madge’s tunnel had become famous for
out-and-out obstinacy throughout the length and breadth of
the land.</p>

<p>Madge saw him coming and ran to meet him, her brown
hand outstretched. The engineers and the main contractors
looked on with wide eyes, for Joshua, since he had been shot,
had gained a certain prominence, and the men doubtless
wondered what could be the connection between the girl
and this construction stiff.</p>

<p>“Oh, but I’m glad to see you out again!” Madge was
saying, and she permitted him to hold her hand rather
longer than was necessary. But, then, Joshua had been
wounded, it will be remembered. “There are your enemies,
and they’re eyeing us rather oddly,” she whispered.
“Buck right up to ’em, old kid! I think I’ll call you that
now and then,” she laughed. “You and I are only kids,
after all. And I, for one, have become tired of playing
grown up. Go right at Demarest with your proposition.
I’ll back you up. I’m still manager of this
camp.”</p>

<p>Joshua released her hand reluctantly and turned toward
the watching group. At Shanty Madge’s side he walked
toward them, and Demarest gave him a brief nod as the
pair drew near.</p>

<p>Philip Demarest was a bluff, rough-and-ready old contractor,
worth millions, but very human. He had come up
from the grade—first a common laborer, then a gypo man,
and finally the head of one of the biggest contracting firms
in the United States. He was kindly, erratic, outspoken,
and a terror when roused to anger. Now his blue eyes
looked at Joshua in wonderment, and the blue veins in
his ruddy cheeks and about his pudgy nose stood out prominently,
as was their way when the man’s interest or curiosity
was aroused. He plucked at his stubby, well-trimmed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
white beard while he waited for Joshua to have his say, for
by every token Joshua had a say.</p>

<p>“Mr. Demarest,” said Joshua, “I’d like to talk with you
about stopping the slide in this tunnel. I understand you
have offered five thousand dollars to the man who can stop
it. I’d like to make a try for the money.”</p>

<p>“Humph! Would, eh? And who are you?”</p>

<p>“My name is Cole, and I’m a hammerman at your Camp
One.”</p>

<p>“That <i>so</i>! Heavens to Betsy!” (The contractor’s favorite
expletive.) “Ain’t you the bird that got winged on the
grade here about a month ago?”</p>

<p>“Yes, somebody shot me.”</p>

<p>“The hell they did! What for?”</p>

<p>“I’ve never been able to find out.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Just like that, eh? Well, young fella, what d’ye
savvy about stoppin’ slides in tunnels?”</p>

<p>“I have an idea which I think will work out.”</p>

<p>“The hell ye do! How long you been railroadin’?”</p>

<p>“Not a year, altogether.”</p>

<p>“Humph! Well, what’ll it cost us to stop the slide, followin’
your grand idea?”</p>

<p>“Not much. Not more than you are spending in three
days as matters stand now.”</p>

<p>“Th’ hell! Cheap at half the price. Well, Mr. Cole,
I guess we can’t use you on this job. I got two o’ the best
known and highest-paid rascally engineers in the country
here, and both of ’em are stuck. But say—le’s hear your
plan.”</p>

<p>Joshua smiled. “Write me a check for five thousand
dollars and I’ll give it to you in five minutes,” he said.</p>

<p>“Just like that, eh? And suppose it don’t work?”</p>

<p>“Well, then—then I’ll give you your five thousand
back.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>The engineers, Spruce and Demarest, saw fit to indulge
in hearty laughter at this point; and then Shanty Madge
stepped forward, a deep resentment in her reddish-brown
eyes.</p>

<p>“Mr. Demarest, I’m ashamed of you,” she said. “I’ve
always considered you open-minded, ready to listen to anybody,
and not too big to take off your hat to a man who can
show you something you didn’t know.”</p>

<p>The young engineers looked uncomfortable, for there was
not one among them who did not long for the favor of this
bronze girl of the mountains. Demarest himself looked
at her admiringly, then laid a fatherly hand on her
shoulder.</p>

<p>“Kinda peeved, ain’t you, Madge?” he asked. “Too
much slide here lately, maybe. But you’re right. I do
consider myself an open-minded man, and I do consider
that I’m willin’ to learn from others. Maybe I was showin’
off a little? What d’ye think about it?”</p>

<p>“I guess that’s right.”</p>

<p>“An’ I guess you’re all wrong, young lady. Heavens to
Betsy!—this fella here is gonta get his chance to lay his
plan before us, but if he hadn’t stood a little kiddin’ I’d
’a’ come to the conclusion that he hadn’t it in um to evolve
a plan that was worth our time. Cole—is that your name?—le’s
hear what you have to say. If it sounds good to
the engineers and me, we’ll try it out. And if it works
you’ll get the five thousand without the blink of an eyelid.
That’s the promise of Philip Demarest, for the firm of
Demarest, Spruce and Tillou. And here’s witnesses all
about. Want any of it?”</p>

<p>“It sounds good to me,” said Joshua. “May I use that
table?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>“Hop to it.”</p>

<p>Joshua went slowly toward a collapsible table used by
the engineers and seated himself in a camp chair before
it. He produced paper and a pencil.</p>

<p>“If you’ll gather around,” he invited, “I’ll lay the whole
works before you in two minutes.”</p>

<p>The men and Madge drew close about him and watched
while he drew a rough sketch, which is here reproduced:</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_map.jpg" alt="sketch"></div>

<p>He leaned back and pointed with the pencil.</p>

<p>“Consider that you are above the hill in an aeroplane,
looking down,” he began, “and that you have the gift of
seeing through earth and stone. ‘EE’ represents the hill.
‘A’ is the tunnel. ‘B’ is the point to where the tunnel had
progressed when the slide occurred, and also the gap<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
through which the muck is sliding. ‘D’ represents the
slide. ‘C’ is the other end of the tunnel. You could
abandon the ‘A’ end and complete the tunnel by working
the ‘C’ end only, of course, but you are not able to work
enough men on one end to complete the job on time and as
per contract. You must have two gangs working toward
each other. But a slide occurs at ‘B’ which you cannot
stop. It strikes me that the rock roof is thinner at ‘B’
than you found it while working toward ‘B,’ or else the
slide would have occurred before it did. This being the
case, I assume that the rock stratum is heavier on both sides
of ‘B,’ all around it, in fact, than it is at ‘B.’ So all that
we have to do is to work our way around ‘B’ and approach
it from the other end.</p>

<p>“And to do this in the least possible time I suggest a
coyote hole—‘F,’ ‘G,’ ‘H’ and ‘I’—a very small tunnel
through what in all probability is solid stone, the workmen
timbering up ahead of them and shooting very light.
Especial care must be taken when they make the turn from
‘H’ to ‘I,’ and all along ‘I’ until the slide is reached.
Then when they reach the slide let them timber soundly,
and continue timbering through the slide until they reach
the other end of it. And when all is timbered, you can go
right ahead with your big tunnel with no fear of another
slide. Is that all clear?”</p>

<p>For fully a quarter of a minute nobody spoke. All stood
studying the diagram. Then came the heavy voice of the
first expert engineer who had come from the East.</p>

<p>“Utter rot!” he opined. “Tell me, will you, why we
will be able to work through the slide and timber up ahead
of us any easier from your small tunnel, ‘I,’ than from
where we are now? Your idea is a howling farce.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry you think so,” said Joshua, very red in the
face. “But my plan hinges on the feature that the slide is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
traveling in a slanting direction toward ‘B.’ And the
coyote hole, ‘I,’ runs into the slide from the other direction.
You have no roof above you now to hold back the
slide. But ‘I’ has been run through solid stone, and has a
solid roof above it. And when you timber from ‘I’ into
the slide, you haven’t the pressure against you that you
have at the other end of the main tunnel. <i>You’ve worked
behind the pressure, can’t you see?</i>”</p>

<p>Another moment or two of silence, then from Philip
Demarest: “Heavens to Betsy, boys! He’s right! It’s
simple as the nose on your face, and a ten-year-old kid
oughta figgered it out. Do you see it, boys? Do you see
it? This bird gets behind the pressure of the slide instead
of buckin’ it. God, but we’ve been a pack of fools!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Demarest!” cried Madge. “Do you mean it?
Do you actually mean it?”</p>

<p>“I mean we’re gonta try it as quick as we can get to
work!” he yelled excitedly. “It may not work at all, but
it’s the only sensible thing that’s been advanced since the
timbers and baled hay failed to hold her. And if she does
work—this bird’s not only made his five thousand bucks, but
he’s got a job that he won’t be ashamed to tell his folks
about.”</p>

<p>Ten minutes after Demarest’s violent decision to give
Joshua’s plan a trial a gang was at work on the preliminaries
of the coyote hole. Joshua was disappointed in not
being permitted to boss the job himself, and had no chance
to bring Bluenose and his other fellow-workers into the
limelight. But he was not yet well enough to have stood
the strain of a day in the coyote hole, and there would be
no room in there, anyway, for a man who was merely boss.
He remained at the camp, the guest of Shanty Madge and
her mother, and every day he crawled to the tunnel and
spent his time there until sheer weariness forced him down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>A night gang and a day gang worked intermittently, and
the coyote hole was growing fast. All efforts to remove the
hilltop through the mouth of the main tunnel had ceased,
and men awaited with eagerness the outcome of the new
experiment.</p>

<p>In less than two weeks the night gang turned the last
corner and were “coyoteing” toward the slide. Every
care was taken now; the timbering was careful and heavy,
the shots extremely light. So far there had been no suggestion
of a cave-in in the roof, but the real test of Joshua’s
theory would come when they reached the slide and attempted
to timber through it, and remove the muck through
the coyote hole.</p>

<p>The engineers, Demarest, Tillou, and Joshua spent much
of their time at the mouth of the coyote hole now, waiting
for word from within. And at last, about ten o’clock one
morning, one of the powdermen came out and reported:</p>

<p>“We’ve struck de slide, bossman.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, yes!” cried Demarest. “And is she holdin’,
ol’-timer?”</p>

<p>The dyno raked a stream of perspiration from his forehead
with his forefinger. “She’s holdin’ so far,” he answered,
and dived back into his hole on hands and knees.</p>

<p>And hold it did until, five days later, the men had worked
their way entirely through the slide, which the great timbers
now served to keep in place. Then came a moment when
the anxious men in the main tunnel heard them at work
beyond the partition of slush that separated them. And
an hour after this a timber came poking through, then
another, and another, and in fifteen minutes the coyote
hole was joined to the main tunnel, with solid roofing overhead.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Joshua Cole to Demarest, “begin working
to right and left and widen your coyote hole until it is of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
the same dimension as the tunnel, and go ahead as if nothing
had occurred. I guess I win, Mr. Demarest.”</p>

<p>There was a choke in his voice, and there were tears on
the bronze cheeks of Shanty Madge. Demarest’s voice, too,
was husky as he said:</p>

<p>“Yes, you win, Cole. You win five thousand at one
rattle outa the box, and anything you want in the way of
a job with Demarest, Spruce and Tillou.”</p>

<p>But Joshua shook his head. “Thanks,” he said in a low
tone. “You’re mighty kind and appreciative, but I’ll take
only the five thousand. I have no desire to become a railroad
builder—I have other plans.”</p>

<p>“But, man, you’re made!” cried Demarest. “You’ll be
known all over the country in no time as Cole, the man
who stopped the famous Mundy slide, when two of the
biggest engineers in the U. S. failed. Don’t throw away
such a chance as that! Take your five thousand and study
engineering—your job’ll be waiting for you when you’re
through.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, no,” Joshua returned, embarrassed; “I have
no brain for engineering. What I did was just the result
of common sense, and I couldn’t probably do anything like
it again in a thousand years. No, I have other plans.”</p>

<p>“Joshua,” cried Madge, “do you realize what you’re
doing? You have nothing—this is the chance of a lifetime!”</p>

<p>“I realize that,” he told her, “but I can’t accept. Here
it is September. You perhaps don’t know that on the
eighteenth of next June the planet Mars will occupy the
best position for observation since Nineteen-nine. And
there will not be another chance so good until August, Nineteen
twenty-four. So I must get well, build a cabin on my
homestead and in general prepare for the hard winter that
is predicted in these mountains. Then I must build a trail<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
to the summit of Spyglass Mountain, put up my observatory,
and install the eight-inch telescope that I have now
decided to buy. The snows will hamper my work next
winter, so that it will keep me rustling to have everything
in readiness for the eighteenth of next June.”</p>

<p>“What’s all this? What in thunder ye talkin’ about?”
barked Philip Demarest.</p>

<p>“Madge will tell you,” said Joshua. “I’m going down
to camp now for a little rest, if you’ll excuse me. I find
that I’m pretty much all in from the strain and excitement
of the last few hours. And that big engineer, Branscomb,
nearly pumped the arm off me, on the side where I got
shot. You explain for me, Madge. Good-by and—thanks!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIII<br>

<small>“WHEN THE MOMENT COMES!”</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ELIZABETH MUNDY found it necessary to fold
Joshua in her arms and kiss him when he and
Madge reported the triumph of his idea. The three
sat together in the Mundys’ comfortable little tent, Madge
very thoughtful, with hands in pockets and legs stretched
out before her and crossed; her handsome mother rocking
gently in a little maple rocker; Joshua seated at the table
reading the letter that notified Mrs. Mundy that her homestead
claim had been allowed. They began to plan.</p>

<p>“California Bill dropped in on me a few days before I
left the hospital,” said Joshua. “It was he who warned
me against the coming hard winter. Bill is something of a
scientist himself, but he doesn’t realize it. He told me
about the millions of yellowjackets that he had seen hovering
over the mud on the lakeshore. That, he says, is one
sure sign of a hard winter in the San Antonios. Also, he
says that the ground squirrels are burrowing far back
from the water, in anticipation of a rise in the lake, I suppose—and
that’s another sign.</p>

<p>“Now, by the time snow flies, the steel won’t be laid on
the new railroad. So that means that we’ve got to depend
on freighters coming from Spur to Ragtown for our supplies.
Unless we have a team of our own and can freight
them in ourselves. That would save us money, of course.
First, though, we’ll have to bring in lumber for the
cabins—and for stables, for I’m going to have one horse
at least. All my life I’ve wanted a saddle horse. Now,
Madge, what are you going to have left from the wreck<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
of your fortunes?—if you’ll forgive me for bringing up a
painful subject.”</p>

<p>“It’s hard to tell just now,” she replied absently, her
eyes fixed on the floor. “But the slide has put us so badly
in debt that I imagine it will take about everything to
square us with the world. Mr. Demarest and I will get
at it to-morrow. Ugh! How I dread it!”</p>

<p>“And to think,” mused Joshua, “that if I hadn’t stopped
that thirty-thirty bullet I could have saved your outfit for
you! It seems to me that some subtle power was at work
to make things turn out as they did. Your mother wanted
you to stop railroading. And I’m afraid that I did too.
And—”</p>

<p>“And I don’t give a whoop—now,” Madge interrupted.</p>

<p>All three were silent after this, each wrapped in his or
her own thoughts.</p>

<p>“You, though, Joshua, failed to-day to show the same
common sense that stopped the slide,” said Madge at last.
“You are a man—a young man at that—just making a
start. You earned a neat little piece of money and a big
reputation in one fell swoop. And then Demarest offers
you anything you want in the way of a position—and that
doesn’t mean a mere job—and you turn him down. Why,
boy—kid, I mean—he would have made you! I failed because
I’m only a girl. You are a man; and with your
brains and ability to figure things out, there’s no limit
to what you might attain in big construction.”</p>

<p>“But the fact remains,” he pointed out, blissfully
warmed by her praise, “that I have no inclination for construction
work. I have set my heart on astronomy. That’s
what I’m fitted for. When all’s said and done, it was the
fact that my parents and old Silvanus Madmallet, my
teacher, tried to make me learn something for which I
was not fitted that sent me to the House of Refuge. No,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
my path is laid out for me—I’ll follow it to the bitter
end.”</p>

<p>Madge repeated the question that she had put to him
when he first called at the Mundys’ camp: “But is there
any money in it?”</p>

<p>“As I told you before,” he replied, a trifle nettled, “I
don’t know. Nor do I care. I’m not out for money.”</p>

<p>“But one <i>has</i> to have it, Joshua! Have you no ambition?”</p>

<p>“Does he? Not much, I’m thinking. Ambition, eh? So
you, too, consider ambition in terms of money. My ambition
is to add something worth while to the knowledge of
the race. If I’m paid for it, well and good. And if I’m
not I’ll manage to struggle along. How ’bout it, Mrs.
Mundy? You’ll back me up. Do you consider that a
fellow can have no ambition merely because he doesn’t
hanker for wealth?”</p>

<p>“By no means,” she replied quickly. “And Madge
doesn’t either. Just the same, Joshua, matters are different
with you. You are a man and have a goal to work
for. We are only two women, with nothing to work for
but a living. What else can we hope to get from the
homestead, provided the land is productive, a market develops,
and we are able to carry on the work? For my
part, of course, I would almost be content to live a simple
life in these mountains, away from the strife and hurry of
the world, with plenty of books and magazines and music,
and with now and then a trip out to some city to feed
up on everything that civilization has to offer. That would
make for the keenest appreciation of what men call the
good things in life. What city people see every day palls
on them, and they become fretful, blasé, unappreciative.
But to me, fairly reveling in it two or three times a year,
it would bring a wonderful satisfaction. I guess you feel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
the same way about it, Joshua. But whether Madge does
or not is a question.”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry about me, Ma,” Madge put in. “I’ll try
anything once.”</p>

<p>“But we don’t want you to feel that way about it,
Madge,” Joshua told her.</p>

<p>“But I do feel that way about it,” she retorted shortly,
“so let’s forget it.”</p>

<p>Joshua slumped down in his chair, and copied Madge
by extending his legs and crossing them at the ankles.
Then he tamped the burning tobacco in his briar pipe and
gave his soul to dreams.</p>

<p>“For me,” he said, “what I consider an ideal life is just
opening. I love the freedom of these majestic mountains,
the grandeur of the clean, cool forests, the fascinating
colors of the lake. Up here a person can be himself and
will be able to rise above the petty squabbles, struggles,
ambitions, hatreds, and copycatism of life in the congested
districts. I’m more or less a caveman, I guess, so far as
my physical well-being is concerned. Listen to this:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first2">“‘“And I, too, sing the song of all creation,—</div>
<div class="verse">A brave sky and a glad wind blowing by,</div>
<div class="verse">A clear trail and an hour for meditation,</div>
<div class="verse">A long day and the joy to make it fly;</div>

<div class="verse">A good strife and no great regret to leave it,</div>
<div class="verse">A still night and the far red lights of home.”’”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Again the trio lapsed into reverie, which the girl was
the one to break.</p>

<p>“I tried to tell Mr. Demarest about your astronomical
studies,” she announced, “but I suppose I made a botch
of it. He called you a fool, swung away from me, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
let it go at that. But of course I couldn’t be expected to
explain what you told him about Mars occupying the best
position for observation next June, simply because I know
nothing about it myself. What did you mean, Joshua?”</p>

<p>“Just what I said,” he told her. “On the eighteenth
of June, next year, Mars will be about forty-two million
miles from the earth. By the end of August the distance
will be increased to sixty-six million miles. And this closeness
will not occur again until August, Nineteen twenty-four.
So you see that I must hurry to get everything ready
to make the most of an opportunity that will not come
again for over two years.”</p>

<p>“And what do you hope to find out next June?”</p>

<p>Joshua did not reply at once, but slumped down lower,
absently sucking at a dead pipe. Then he roused himself.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you,” he said, as if the decision to expose his
ideas had just come upon him. “But”—his grave eyes
twinkled—“I warn you at the start that there probably
will be no money in it.</p>

<p>“I have a theory,” he went on. “I am one of those who
firmly believe that the planet Mars is inhabited. Also I
believe, with others, that the inhabitants are trying to
communicate with us. You have been reading the papers,
of course, and you probably know that on the first of this
month, I think it was, Signor Marconi made some experiments
on the yacht <i>Electra</i>, and made the announcement
that he had received wireless waves of greater length than
those of the highest-powered station in the world. Hence,
he argued, these waves could not have originated on the
earth. However, he did not say, as he was reported to
have said, that he thought these communications—if such
they were—came from Mars. Still, he would not say that
such a thing was improbable.</p>

<p>“Edison has expressed the belief that the inhabitants of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
some heavenly body are even now trying to communicate
with us, and has predicted that wireless from star to star
will be an accomplished fact within the next few years.</p>

<p>“Then the American scientist, Mr. B. McAfee, says that
he is convinced that life exists on Mars, and he expects to
prove it.”</p>

<p>“But what makes them think so?” Madge queried, her
interest aroused as it had been on the night when Joshua
told her about the good ship “Argo,” far off in Hathaway.
“Now make it as simple as possible, please.”</p>

<p>Joshua Cole’s eyes grew dreamier still. “Arguments
are advanced by certain scientists that Mars is physically
incapable of sustaining life,” he told his listeners. “This,
they claim, is because of its thin atmosphere, low mean
temperature, and small amount of oxygen and water vapor.
Despite all this, I believe that plant life and animal life
exist on that planet.</p>

<p>“Through my own refractor—heavens, how I’ve missed
it!—I have seen great white patches, occasionally covering
an area of some three hundred thousand square miles of
the Martian surface. That’s about six times the size of the
State of New York, Madge. These white patches I have
observed to come and go, and in the course of time they
were followed by green patches covering the same region.
And later the green patches turned brown. To me, all this
signifies the accumulation of vast masses of watery vapor,
the precipitation of rain, the springing into life of green
vegetation, and the gradual drying up of the soil and the
conversion of the green growth into patches of brown,
dried-up plants.</p>

<p>“Again, if there is no water vapor on Mars, how does it
come that frost patches can occasionally be observed in the
Martian summer?—which, by the way, lasts for one hundred
and forty-nine days. I’ve seen these frost patches—have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span> 
seen them disappear before the rising sun just as they
would on this earth. They never last until noon. And it is
well known that at rare intervals atmospheric storms have
appeared in projection on the sunrise edge of the planet.</p>

<p>“But, laying all this aside, it is the canal system on
Mars that convinces me it is inhabited. It consists of a
beautiful network of long line-like markings, continuous
and uniform throughout, encompassing the planet from
pole to pole. These lines have definite beginnings and
definite endings, and each proceeds with definite directness
from one oasis—or dark, oval area—to another. In some
cases these lines are near together in pairs, and mathematically
straight. Double canals, these are called. In
other cases two lines intersect, and then both continue to
run precisely on their own straight courses. Now, do natural
markings on this earth—rivers, for instance—do that?
Then are we not justified in the assumption that these geometrical
lines on Mars are the work of intelligent engineers?
And are we not justified in assuming, also, that these
canals were constructed for the growing of vegetation?”</p>

<p>“Just a moment, please,” put in Mrs. Mundy. “What
are the oases?”</p>

<p>Joshua assumed a pedagogic attitude.</p>

<p>“The oases,” he explained, “are probably round or oval
lakes, fed by the irrigating water courses, probably serving
as reservoirs or distributing centers, and forming centers
of civilization—cities or urbanlike farming communities.
They average about three hundred miles in diameter. The
northern hemisphere of Mars is mostly desert, but crossed
by canals as they travel toward the regions where vegetation
is grown. Some of the canals are as much as eighty
miles in breadth—and average about thirty miles. The
word canals includes water and vegetation.</p>

<p>“During the winter months the canals are so faint as to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
be invisible in most cases. Beginning at the snow line, the
canals assume a blue-green color—a sort of robin’s egg blue—which
eventually extends to the entire system. With the
approach of autumn the color changes, and instead of
green the canals become a reddish-ochre, or russet, remaining
this color until winter, when they begin to grow gradually
fainter, and sometimes disappear entirely.</p>

<p>“Now, to return to our theory of irrigation, the irrigation
of an entire planet, as seems to me to be the case on
Mars, certainly would tax the mathematical and engineering
abilities of experts on our own earth. And this wonderful
system of irrigation canals—one of them over three
thousand miles in length—is not the pipe dream of some
over-imaginative star gazer. Many of the canals have been
recorded repeatedly on the one hundred thousand photographs
made at the Lowell Observatory during the past
fifteen years.</p>

<p>“Well, now, ye thirsters for learning who have come to
the fountain head of wisdom, let us assume that Mars is
inhabited. Let us say, further, that her inhabitants are
intelligent beings—far more intelligent than we, as proved
by their amazing system of canals. And let us adopt the
belief that these super-intelligent Martians are striving
desperately to communicate with us. They may have discovered
radio, and the wireless waves received by Marconi
may indicate an attempt to get in touch with us. But we
don’t know for sure that those waves came from Mars or
any other planet. What we do know, however, is that the
Martians excel in engineering; and we have no proof that
they excel us in anything else.</p>

<p>“So then, since we understand engineering after a fashion,
isn’t it logical to harbor the hypothesis that the Martians
may resort to their knowledge of engineering to establish
communication with us?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>“Communication by means of wireless waves may be all
right for Marconi and others, but it’s out of my line. I’m
a telescope fiend, and I’m hoping to prove that Mars is
trying to communicate with us through the medium of
sight instead of sound. So during my last few years in the
House of Refuge, and even while I was tramping over the
country with my friend The Whimperer, I spent many
nights while Mars was in opposition to the earth in looking
for some physical demonstration on the part of the
Martian engineers.</p>

<p>“There is but one universal language, and that is mathematics.
And it is my belief that the Martians are trying
to communicate with the earth by excavating canals which
will, when completed, form a geometrical figure that could
not possibly be misinterpreted as having been fashioned by
natural causes. Canals could be constructed for the purpose
of letting us know that the Martians are intelligent
beings, and at the same time these same canals could serve
them as waterways for irrigating purposes.</p>

<p>“And I think—I’m almost sure—that such a figure, on
a colossal scale, is being made for us to see. I think that
I have seen it growing, and it was that one fleeting glimpse
that gave me my theory. After that I was constantly on
the lookout, until The Whimperer stole my telescope, but
saw nothing after that first unusual observation. You
perhaps do not understand fully that, even though such a
figure were constructed on an enormous scale, it might become
visible for only a moment or two at one time, even
under the most favorable atmospheric conditions. Even
established astronomers, using the world’s greatest telescopes,
might miss that rare, exceptional moment. They
might be looking in the wrong place, you know. And, besides,
the higher magnifying powers can seldom be used
advantageously in observations of the Martian surface. If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
a keen-eyed, tireless observer has a small telescope favorably
situated he may be the first to glimpse such a signal
when the rare moment arrives. For the canals of Mars
may be looked for in vain, night after night, with mighty
telescopes, and yet remain invisible. Then suddenly comes
a moment of exceptionally good seeing, as telescopists call
it, and the fine, hairlike lines stand forth in all their fascinating
geometrical symmetry—for one brief moment only!
And what if I, Joshua Cole, inmate of a reform school for
over six long years, tramp, construction stiff, should be on
watch on Spyglass Mountain when that moment comes!...
I thank you for your kind attention!”</p>

<p>Madge began to speak, but was interrupted by a smart
hand-clapping at the door of the tent, and a male voice
boomed:</p>

<p>“Good! Fine! Give us the other barrel! I don’t know
who you are, but you’re there with the goods!”</p>

<p>“Why, Jack! Where did you come from?” cried Madge,
as the flaps were parted and a good-looking, brown-haired
young man stood revealed in a gray Norfolk suit and shiny
puttees, with a leather quirt hanging by a thong from his
wrist.</p>

<p>“Hello, Madge! Hello, Ma Mundy! How’s the old slide
coming down?”</p>

<p>Smiling genially and confidently, the young man stepped
into the room and shook hands with Mrs. Mundy and
Madge. Then, with an amused twinkle in his fine brown
eyes, he turned and surveyed the young astronomer, who
had risen from his seat.</p>

<p>“Joshua,” said Madge, “this is Mr. Jack Montgomery.
Jack—Mr. Joshua Cole, the hero of the day, the expert
slide-stopper and adviser of world-famous engineers—Cole
of Spyglass Mountain!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIV<br>

<small>WATER AT RAGTOWN</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">JACK MONTGOMERY proved himself to be an affable
young man, admittedly wise in the ways of the
world, distinctly of the earth, earthy. Joshua inferred
from his conversation that the contracting firm of
which his father was the head was struggling along bravely
without meddlesome advice from him. He spent a great
deal of his time out of the mountains, and had much to
say about recent plays, repeated many golf-links stories,
and claimed that if he hadn’t returned to the mountains
when he did he would have danced his head off. When in
the mountains he rode about on horseback from camp to
camp, “kidding” his friends, and visiting Shanty Madge.
He was older than Joshua. He had been graduated from
an Eastern college, and considered the achievement sufficient
laurels on which to rest.</p>

<p>There were two distinct reasons why Joshua Cole did not
like him: He was insincere, and he thought himself in love
with Shanty Madge. Montgomery laughed at Joshua’s
theory of life on Mars, and though it was plain that he
recognized in the young astronomer a man with the capacity
for deep thinking, he treated him with a sort of polite
tolerance which Joshua found hard to bear.</p>

<p>Montgomery considered himself a modern gentleman.
Joshua Cole was the scion of a long and illustrious line of
gentlemen. With no social training whatever beyond what
his mother had given him before he was sent to the House
of Refuge, the instinct with which Joshua had been endowed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
at birth gave him an air which convinced others that
he was a man of culture. Montgomery was patently puzzled
at this, especially after he learned that Joshua had
been a hammerman for Demarest, Spruce and Tillou until
he had stopped the slide.</p>

<p>Madge and Montgomery talked about many things that
did not concern or interest Joshua, so he gave his attentions
to Mrs. Mundy, and together they planned their future
on the homesteads. When Joshua took his leave, an
hour after the noonday meal, he was unable to interpret
Madge’s attitude toward Jack Montgomery. He realized
fully, however, that Jack had many things to offer her,
which, if Joshua were to attempt an offer of the same, would
call for sacrifices too great for him to make. It would mean
his complete abandonment of the study of astronomy and
his immediate acceptance of Demarest’s impulsive offer—in
short, Montgomery’s offerings spelled money with a capital
M.</p>

<p>Now Joshua became a busy man. First, he mailed his
check to a Los Angeles bank and opened an account. Next,
he sent two thousand dollars to the publishers of a scientific
journal, in which he had seen advertised a second-hand
eight-inch telescope. It had been the property of an astronomer
who had recently died, and his family, having no use
for the instrument and finding themselves in need of
money, had made an offer to dispose of it at an astonishing
sacrifice. If the publishers considered the telescope all that
it should be, Joshua’s letter authorized them to turn over
the check to the owners and to at once ship the instrument
to him. His great fear was that the bargain had been
snapped up long ago, for when he first saw the advertisement
his longing heart had not dared to hope that in less
than a month he would be in a position to avail himself of
the opportunity. And his next move was to gather together<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
his pitifully few belongings—including the half-constructed
telescope which was now become a mockery—and,
with a small tent and camp outfit, which California Bill
freighted in for him, go to his claim and establish residence.</p>

<p>Then when his tent was pitched under the sprawling
junipers, and his provisions cached, he took stage for Spur
and train for Los Angeles, where he notified the land office
that he had taken up residence on his claim. But another
matter had brought him to the city, for he could have
notified the land office in the form of a letter. The next
morning after his arrival found him in a saddlery store,
where he gave in to a natural inclination to emulate a
drunken sailor and bought a saddle, a bridle, and a set of
martingales.</p>

<p>For Joshua Cole, despite his seriousness, still cherished
the boyish ambition to ride in a picturesque saddle and
appear as a picturesque son of the West. Great thinkers
invariably have tucked away in their brains a little spring,
which, when unexpectedly released, reveals a flaw in their
mental equilibrium. The flaw is always some delightfully,
laughably human conceit, trait, hobby, or perhaps merely a
great longing for something unattainable and amusingly
foreign to what they have set out to do in life. And the
flaw in the brain of Joshua Cole demanded a prancing
horse, a hand-carved saddle with low-swinging tapaderos, a
plaited, silver-mounted bridle with martingales to match,
and some one to stare at him open-mouthed as he rode by.
Can Joshua be forgiven for this, when we remember that
Ben Jonson took great delight in counting the pickets of
a fence as he walked along, and, if he made a mistake, retraced
his course to rectify the error, and that Edgar Allen
Poe was inordinately proud of the small size of his feet?</p>

<p>The horse he bought upon his return to the desert, one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
which California Bill had told him, a dapple gray five years
old, half broncho, quarter Kentucky thoroughbred, and
quarter just horse. And Joshua was five hundred dollars
poorer, but gloriously content, as he rode into Ragtown,
bought a sack of tobacco—though he had a full sack in his
pocket and a carton of them in camp—and then galloped
on around the lake toward home. The erstwhile owner of
the gray had called him Prince, but Joshua had changed
his name to Argo. He could sail over the desert, his fine
white mane and tail a-stream in the wind, like the mythical
ship that sailed with the Argonauts questing for the golden
fleece. But there was another reason why Joshua called
him Argo!</p>

<p>Joshua did not at once buy lumber with which to build
his shacks, for he was waiting until the Mundys had settled
their affairs with Demarest, Spruce and Tillou, when they
would order together, and perhaps he would haul the loads
with such equipment as the Mundys could manage to save.
So for the present he occupied his time by sinking a shallow
well and beginning his trail up Spyglass Mountain.</p>

<p>Unfortunately there was no spring on Joshua’s land, but
the piece taken by Mrs. Mundy boasted one. However,
Joshua struck good water twelve feet from the surface.
He lined his well with stones and covered it with brush
until such time as he could build a wellcurb over it.</p>

<p>Argo was content on a picket rope down by the lake,
where the saltgrass grew. The wandering cattle did not
disturb him, but their constant cropping of the grass made
it necessary to move the horse quite frequently. When
the well was lined Joshua began mapping out his trail to
the top of the mountain, and while he was engaged in this
Madge rode up one day and shouted to him to come down.</p>

<p>Joshua discarded his pick and shovel and retraced that
part of the trail already made. Madge had dismounted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
before his tent, and was sitting on her heels, cowpuncher
fashion, holding the black’s reins in her hand.</p>

<p>“Well, Joshua, here you are,” she said. “We’ve been
wondering why you have deserted us, but I suppose you’ve
been busy.”</p>

<p>“I intended to ride around to-morrow,” he explained,
and proudly pointed to his new equestrian outfit and the
dapple gray at graze beside the lake.</p>

<p>“My! My!” she cried. “What a spendthrift! But I
haven’t time to stop long. I just rode over to tell you
that we’ve paid our pound of flesh and are almost ready
to move onto the homestead. We’ll have about two thousand
dollars in the bank, and I saved two span of my best
mules, with harness, a couple of good wagons, a few slips
and a scraper, all of the blacksmith tools, lots of hand tools,
and—oh, a lot of junk! We feel quite prosperous. And
now we’re through. Ma and I have nobody to depend on
now but you. So whenever you’re ready, we’ll appreciate
it if you will come over and help us move.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be over to-morrow morning,” he told her. “Are
you glad it’s over with, Madge? Will you be content?”</p>

<p>“I’m glad it’s all over—yes. And as to my being content,
you’ll have to take a shrug for an answer. Couldn’t
you ride over to-night with me, so we can get to work early
in the morning?”</p>

<p>“You bet!” cried Joshua, and grasped his saddle by the
horn to shoulder it. “Let’s go!”</p>

<p>At ten o’clock the following morning Joshua drove a
team of mules hitched to a laden wagon from the camp that
the Mundys were deserting forever. Argo and Madge’s
black gelding followed the wagon on lead-ropes. Shanty
Madge, with her mother on the seat beside her, drove the
other wagon and followed Joshua, and behind her trailed a
wheeler. The white-aproned cook came out as they passed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
and waved his cap. A flunky at the woodpile lowered his
ax and called good-by. Up at the works some of the men
spied them, and a long shout of good will came down to
them. The new manager, a Demarest, Spruce and Tillou
man, hurried from his office tent, and, finding himself too
late to offer his hand, stood spread-legged and waved his
wide-brimmed hat.</p>

<p>There were tears in the reddish-brown eyes of Shanty
Madge as she waved back right and left, but she straightened
her sturdy shoulders and shouted ahead, a little tremblingly,
to Joshua:</p>

<p>“Push ’em in the collar, old-timer! It’s a long trip, and
we’ve got a load!”</p>

<p>“You poor dear brave child!” said her mother. “This
is breaking your heart, yet you’re taking defeat like your
father always did—with a shrug of the shoulders, and up
and at ’em again!”</p>

<p>“Pooh!” sniffled Madge. “One has to experience a setback
now and then, Ma, to get new adventures out of life
and keep from growing stale. This is gonta be good! Hey,
Joshua!” she shouted ahead. “I feel like an old-time
pioneer! Thus was the wilderness subdued! Hey, old-timer?”</p>

<p>“Thus was she subdued!” Joshua shouted back.</p>

<p>Philip Demarest had been considerate in settling up with
Shanty Madge, and to cover her indebtedness had selected
such articles as would be of no use to her as a homesteader.
So Madge had been permitted to help herself to commissary
supplies and baled hay, and there were three more loads
to be hauled after they were settled. Demarest’s thoughtfulness
had made it possible for the homesteaders to fill
their larder for many months to come, but there were a few
things still needed, and to buy them Joshua stopped his
little wagon train at Ragtown about one o’clock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>While he was watering the stock Madge made the few
purchases that were necessary. It was Ragtown’s quietest
hour, for the revelers were still sleeping off the drunkenness
of the night before and the gambling games had not
yet opened up. From the doors of saloons here and there
came an occasional loud voice or a burst of throaty laughter,
breaking in harshly on the mountain stillness.</p>

<p>As Joshua was leading his team from the trough to make
room for Madge’s he saw, leaning against the corrugated-iron
front of The Silver Dollar, his kid enemy of the House
of Refuge, Felix Wolfgang. He was the picture of lassitude.
A brown-paper cigarette hung from his lower lip.
He wore a fancy striped-silk shirt and a vest made of
green billiard-table topping, with six five-dollar gold pieces
for buttons. The vest was open, showing the flowing ends
of a black-satin tie, its knot held firm by a diamond stickpin.
A broad-brimmed Stetson hat, carefully creased to a
Mexican peak, looked enormous above his cadaverous face
and seemed to cause his many freckles to stand out more
plainly. His eyes were insolent, as always, as he gazed
with half-interest at Joshua, which interest was quickened
as Shanty Madge’s lithe figure came from the store and
post office and crossed toward the wagons.</p>

<p>She was scarce ten feet from The Silver Dollar when
several men appeared behind her in the door. They watched
her as she crossed the street and mounted to the elevated
seat beside her mother. Then a man slightly behind the
rest pushed his way through and came staggering after her.</p>

<p>“Lee, c’mere! C’mon back here, Sweet! Get onto yerself!”
called several voices in semi-guarded tones, but the
man paid no heed and kept on across the road.</p>

<p>He was such a man as one seldom sees in cities. He was
a tall, burly giant, well proportioned and with a stride that
was confident for all its present wobbliness. His face was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
large and red, and a half-moon of leonine whiskers, coarse
and curly as a frayed-out hempen rope, encompassed his
jaw. He wore a Columbia-shape black Stetson, a purple-and-green-plaid
flannel shirt, a black-silk neckerchief with
a silver clasp, fringed leather chaps, and high-heeled cowboy
boots with fancy quilted tops of morocco leather, on the
counters of which hung large-roweled silver-mounted spurs.
Petulant, domineering brown eyes were set deep in his unsymmetrical
skull, and the corners of them displayed
“sleepy men,” caused by a night of drinking and a morning
of fortification against repentant hours to come.</p>

<p>Once more some man called to him to come back and
“’tend to his own business,” but his chap-clad legs whistled
on until he swayed before the astonished Joshua.</p>

<p>“So you’re the Ike they’re callin’ Cole of Spyglass
Mountain, are ye?” he wanted to know, and he made no
effort to drive sarcasm from his tones.</p>

<p>“I believe I’m to be called that,” Joshua replied good-naturedly.
“But I didn’t know it had got around as yet.”</p>

<p>“Huh! Fancy bird, ain’t ye?”</p>

<p>Joshua smiled tolerantly. “You’d better go back to
The Silver Dollar, hadn’t you?” he asked. “Your friends
want you, I think.”</p>

<p>“Ye do, eh? Well, ye ain’t supposed to think. D’ye
know who I am?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t the pleasure of your acquaintance,” said
Joshua in an amused drawl.</p>

<p>“Haven’t th’ pleasure, eh? Well, then, I’ll interdooce
myself. I’m Lee Sweet, owner o’ Box-R Ranch, halfway
from here to Spur. Now d’ye know me?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ve heard of you,” Joshua told him. “If you’ll
please stand to one side, Mr. Sweet, I’d like to lead that
other team to the water trough.”</p>

<p>“Ne’mind th’ other team, young fella. I got somethin’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
to tell ye. An’ it’s this here: You’re th’ bird that started
this here homesteadin’ around th’ lake, and now a lotta
folks are comin’ in an’ takin’ up good grazin’ land. Ye
can’t raise nothin’ on that soil—it’s plumb full o’ alkali.
Ye’ll all starve to death. An’ ye might’s well make up
yer mind to beat it. That land ain’t good for anythin’ but
grazin’ cows in summer, an’ at that the pickins is poor
enough. But all that’s neither here ner there. My point
is that ye gotta get outa there before I drive ye out. Do
I make myself pretty plain, pardner?”</p>

<p>“But you wouldn’t stop me from watering those mules,
would you?” laughed Joshua in an attempt to humor him.
“Won’t you please stand aside a little? Then when you’re
feeling better, come over and see me and we’ll talk about
this matter.”</p>

<p>“I’m feelin’ fine right now,” Sweet declared. “An’
right now’s the time for me to tell ye I won’t stand fer ye
buttin’ in on my summer pasture.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Joshua, “the government has allowed our
homestead claims and we’ve made some rather extensive
arrangements to go ahead and develop them. I think you’d
better see the land office, Mr. Sweet, if you have any complaint
to make. Really, now, I must be watering this
team so that we can be getting on. We’ve a pile of work to
do before nighttime comes.”</p>

<p>“Ne’mind waterin’ the team now”—and the cattleman
placed himself between Joshua and Madge’s mules.
“What’re ye gonta do?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you,” said Joshua: “If you don’t get out of
my way right now, so that I can lead that team to the
water, I’m going to shove you out of the way. I’ve stood
about all of the browbeating that I usually contract to
stand from anybody. Will you let me water this team,
now?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>“T’ hell with yer team! You get yer things an’ pack up,
and beat it outa—”</p>

<p>But at this point Mr. Lee Sweet was pushed violently
backward by Joshua Cole, and he lost his balance and sat
down in a very undignified manner.</p>

<p>Unconcernedly Joshua started toward the heads of
Madge’s span of mules, and then the girl shouted a warning
from her seat:</p>

<p>“Look out, Joshua! He’s up and—”</p>

<p>Joshua swung about just in time to ward off a blow
from one of the stockman’s heavy fists, but before he
could retaliate a stubby-fingered hand fell on Sweet’s
shoulder, and from then on he had to deal with California
Bill.</p>

<p>“Tut-tut-tut!” came Bill’s soothing drawl. “Lee, I’m
ashamed of ye, all lickered up before these here ladies, an’
carryin’ on plumb <i>cultus</i>, like ye’re doin’! An’ you with
a wife an’ a couple o’ th’ nicest kids this side th’ Tehachapi!
Lee, ye don’t carry yer licker like ye usta—seems.
Come on back to Th’ Silver Dollar an’ try to get a little
sleep.”</p>

<p>The big bewhiskered cattleman stood stock-still and
made no move to show his resentment over the interference
of California Bill. Over in front of The Silver Dollar a
crowd had gathered, watching the altercation in silence.
Slim Wolfgang continued to lean listlessly against the
building, his hat drawn down low over his eyes of faded
blue, the cigarette still drooping from his thin and sallow
lips.</p>

<p>“You mind yer own business, Californy!” Lee Sweet
said to the freighter, but he said it in a way that convinced
nobody that he meant to follow the implied threat with
physical action.</p>

<p>“You darned ole fool!” chuckled California Bill, slapping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
the cowman on the back. “C’mon over to Th’ Dollar
now, an’ try an’ get on yer feet. These here folks ain’t
botherin’ ye, Lee. Why,—why, I’m jest naturally surprised
at ye, ol’-timer! Here’s you, th’ king o’ the mountains,
ye might say, tryin’ to start a quarrel with these here
people on th’ public highway. Le’s you’n’me go h’ist a
couple f’r ole-times’ sake, Lee!”</p>

<p>The big fellow looked into Bill’s genial face for a moment
or two, and then an expression came over his own
that twisted his features as if he had tasted alum water.
His bearded lips trembled, and began working spasmodically,
like the lips of a burro sorting bunchgrass from
a nest of spiny cactus. And behold, two great tears
streamed down into his beard, and his voice broke into a
tremulous boo-hooing that brought a fit of laughter from
Shanty Madge.</p>

<p>“There, there!” soothed California Bill, winking at his
friends and boyishly holding back his laughter with a broad
hand placed across his mouth. “There, there, ol’-timer!
Ye didn’t mean what ye was sayin’ a-tall, Lee—jes’ th’ ole
licker talkin’, eh? And ye’re sorry an’ all, and these here
folks forgive ye ’cause they understand. Now le’s you’n’me
go over to Th’ Silver Dollar and study our blame’ old
nerves. C’mon, Lee—that’s th’ <i>hi-yu skookum</i> thing for us
to do.”</p>

<p>And sobbing and sniffling, the brawny cowman allowed
himself to be led across the street by the stocky freighter,
whose head came below the giant’s shoulders. Bill looked
back as he guided his charge along and winked mischievously,
and once more placed his unoccupied hand across
his lips like a boy who laughs at his elders behind their
backs.</p>

<p>“Can you beat that?” came slangily from Shanty
Madge. “I wonder if that’s the way California Bill took<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
men to the penitentiary when he was deputy sheriff up in
Chaparral?”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t be surprised,” said Joshua, at last able to
lead the thirsting shavetails to the trough. “But I didn’t
know we’d created any enmity. I’m sorry this occurred,
but it’s just as well that we know how matters stand.”</p>

<p>California Bill came rolling across the street before
Joshua had mounted to his wagon seat.</p>

<p>“Hello, there, folks!” he cried, shaking hands all around,
the crow’s-feet dancing under the thick patches of coal-black
hair above his eyes. “Seems like for once I was
Johnny-on-th’-spot. He’d ’a’ fought ye, Tony, all right,
but they ain’t any harm in ’im when he’s sober. Jes’ a big
blusterer, an’ ye don’t wanta pay any attention to ’im
a-tall. He’ll rave an’ faunch about ye’re bein’ th’ one to
start th’ raid on his grazin’, but he’s harmless. He’s
weepin’ over th’ bar now, an’ don’t know I’ve left ’im—seems.
An’ so ye’re on yer way to Spyglass Mountain at
last, eh? I gets in last night, an’ was wonderin’ about ye.
An’, Tony, ye sure taught yer grandmother to suck eggs
when ye sat down on that slide, didn’t ye? Ye’re th’ most
talked-of <i>hombre</i> south o’ th’ Tehachapi right now. Five
thousan’ bucks, eh? C’n ye believe it? I can’t. I never
saw that much money in my life.”</p>

<p>“Here’s that forty that you saw not long ago and then
lost track of, anyway,” laughed Joshua, tendering bills to
the amount that his friend had loaned him.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll take ’er—seein’s it’s you, Tony. An’ look at
our new saddle an’ bridle, will ye? Say, Tony—them are
<i>hi-yu skookum</i> an’ no <i>mis</i>-take. That’ll make ye a character—that
an’ yer doin’s on Spyglass Mountain. I been
spreadin’ that name broadcast from here to Spur, an’ ag’in
th’ trains begin tootin’ on th’ new railroad, they’ll be runnin’
excursions up here to see Cole o’ Spyglass Mountain.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
Ye got a heap o’ taste, my son—a rarin’ <i>hi-yu skookum</i>
taste, I’ll say! Now, them’ll make ye unique, Tony—an’
that’s what ye want. An’ ye jes’ wanta ride into Ragtown
on that rarin’ gray I picked fer ye, with this here lovely
outfit on ’im, get off seriouslike an’ walk into th’ post office,
with yer head down an’ lookin’ neither to th’ right ner left,
get yer mail, tell th’ storekeep to give ye a big two-bit
Havana seegar in a low, quiet tone, light up, take a couple
puffs, an’ then go out an’ fork th’ gray ag’in an’ ride off
slowlike, with yer head still down an’ yer thoughts on
Mars, never sayin’ a word to nobody.”</p>

<p>“Bill, you’re an old hypocrite,” Madge accused.</p>

<p>“Yes’m, I guess ye’re right, Madge. But I know what
a fella’s gotta do to become a character. I’m one—I oughta
know. Well, so-long, folks! Ye gotta be goin’, I know.
Drift ’round an’ see ye next time I ramble in. So-long,
now—be good!”</p>

<p>As the wagons drove out of town Felix Wolfgang continued
to lean against the front of The Silver Dollar and
watch them from under his pulled-down peaked hat.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXV<br>

<small>ON THE ROCKY ROAD TO RAGTOWN</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">FOR over two hours Joshua Cole and Shanty Madge
drove their mules along the north shore of Stirrup
Lake, then turned up through the unbroken sweep of
sagebrush toward Spyglass Mountain. They saw several
camps as they passed along, and it appeared that a colony
of homesteaders had just come in from somewhere outside
the country. Tents had been pitched and stock stood about
and nibbled hay in the wagon beds.</p>

<p>The sage, though breast-high in places, broke easily before
the passage of the mules, and the wagons crackled
their way up the slope, breaking a trail which afterward
was to become a road. Joshua drove to the <i>sienega</i> on Mrs.
Mundy’s claim. Here they climbed down, hurriedly attended
to their stock, and went at the pitching of tents and
the arrangement of various articles necessary to a temporary
camp.</p>

<p>Evening was coming on, for at an early hour the sun
sank beyond Saddle Mountain, and somber shadows were
even now stealing over the placid lake. Elizabeth Mundy
ceased her work and watched the reflection of the sun-bathed
clouds on the surface of the water. The lake lost
its bluish tinge and took on a giddy yellow, which quickly
changed it to a lake of fire so dazzling as to hurt the eyes.
Darker tones crept in—orange, cerise and orange, then
orange splotched with crimson, then crimson for a minute,
which brought forth cries of delight from the women.
Gradually the crimson deepened, and once more the natural
blue came back to blend with the crimson and lend to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
waters a bold violet tone. Then strident purple, then blue
again, then deep indigo, then velvet black.</p>

<p>Far to the south and west loomed lofty mountains, timber-clad
to the line of perpetual snow, dazzling white above.
A soft, fresh breeze blew from the lake and told stories in
the branches of the fragrant junipers. Red-breasted linnets,
songful until now, went twitteringly to sleep in the
juniper tops, and the water gurgled a chanty song to the
pool below the spring. Back of them Spyglass Mountain
upreared itself, its summit gilded with the sun, and at its
base great grotesque rocks stood grimly silent, sentinels
there since the days when the earth was young.</p>

<p>A long sigh escaped the lips of Elizabeth Mundy as she
turned from the blue-black lake. “It will be home,” she
said, “when you’ve built a fire, Joshua.”</p>

<p>And as the flames leaped up and licked at the black
kettle hung over them to boil, the drunken laughter of two
coyotes floated down from some haunted fastness of Spyglass
Mountain.</p>

<p>Later they sat on the ground and ate fried bacon and
boiled potatoes as the cold black mountain night gathered
round them. Away to the east the twinkling lights of
Ragtown threw serpentine swords across the lake like the
blade in the hand of the angel who stood before Adam and
Eve in the garden of Eden. Here and there on the sagebrush
slope between them and the water other campfires
gleamed. Down there the little dabchicks clucked as they
fed on tender water growths, and the mudhens scolded one
another for greediness.</p>

<p>Then Joshua lighted his pipe, and Shanty Madge asked
him about the young man with the resplendent green vest,
who had leaned against the saloon in Ragtown and never
removed his eyes from them throughout the altercation
with Lee Sweet. So Joshua told her of his meeting with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
Slim Wolfgang and The Whimperer, and put it up to her
to solve the strange riddle of the connection between the
pair.</p>

<p>“But, Joshua,” the girl exclaimed, “you never were
actually that tramp’s road-kid, were you?”</p>

<p>“Well,” he replied, “not in the strict sense of the term,
perhaps. He tried to boss me at first, but I was physically
a little too much for him. Still, it took a long time to
shake him, and it has always been a mystery to me just
why I couldn’t. He seemed to have an uncanny luck in
trailing me up. I guess he would have been with me to-day
if my telescope hadn’t tempted him. I’ll bet he had a
glorious jag after he’d peddled it!”</p>

<p>“It’s the strangest thing on earth,” Madge mused, “that
you should encounter these two here in Ragtown. And the
fact that The Whimperer ran through this Wolfgang’s tent
proves to me that there <i>is</i> some bond between them. But
I can’t fathom the mystery.”</p>

<p>They gave it up finally and began planning their future
activities on their homesteads. They decided that next day
Madge and her mother would make themselves comfortable
in a semi-permanent camp, and Joshua would start out of
the mountains for lumber. He would take one team and
drive to Spur. A single team would be sufficient to haul
the load to the foot of the mountains, and there Shanty
Madge would meet him with the other team, and they
would drive four-up to the summit.</p>

<p>Madge was doing most of the planning. Her mother sat
on a camp stool lost in thought. Joshua, stretched on the
ground, looked across the campfire at Madge and watched
the play of the firelight on the girl’s bronze hair.</p>

<p>She too lay prone on the ground, her supple body
relaxed, her hands locked behind her head, her eyes gazing
up at the stars and the black sky.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>Cole of Spyglass Mountain was dreaming dreams. From
boyhood he had been an individualist, a loather of the commonplace
in life. Here, then, was a situation that made
distinct appeal to him, and here was a girl that appealed.
All about was the mountain stillness, for, somehow, the
lover of the outdoors does not estimate the sounds of nature
in terms of noise. The breath of the sage was sweet.
There came from the blackness that welled about the little
circle the sound of the crunching molars of the mules as
they ate their hay. Here indeed was the beginning of an
adventure far from the commonplace, and a girl far from
commonplace was the nucleus of it. What a girl was
Shanty Madge, dethroned gypo queen—a girl who knew
more about horses and mules and wagons, and the ways of
rough, hard men than he did. Yet what a picture of
feminine beauty she made as she lazed beside the campfire,
all woman, all rounded curves of loveliness! And he—Joshua
Cole—had sought for her and found her out in the
West of his boyhood dreams—and she was here with him,
with only a flickering blaze between them—and, in a
measure, her happiness was in his hands.</p>

<p>And so with her picture in his heart he arose, said good-night
softly, and trailed away through the blackness toward
his own little tent.</p>

<p>He was away at dawn behind one of the teams of mules,
his wagon rumbling musically through the weird silence of
the infancy of another day. The shavetails topped the
summit, wound their way down the mountain, around Hairpin
Curve and Shirt-tail Bend, across Yucca Flat and
Cactus Slope, and down to the yellow desert—to Wild
Woman Springs and Box-R Ranch, to Bobcat Point, and on
through the rocky pass to Spur. Two days later he was
returning over the sandy waste, with a groaning load of
lumber under him. And when he reached the foot of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
mountains, late in the evening of the second day, he found
Madge Mundy awaiting him with the helper span of mules.</p>

<p>He had not expected her that night. The plan had been
for him to camp at the beginning of the grade whenever he
reached it, and to wait there for the coming of the girl next
day. But to save time and get an early morning start,
Madge placidly informed him, she had decided to come that
afternoon and camp with him that night.</p>

<p>She noted the color and the worried look in his face, and
laughed without a blush.</p>

<p>“Chaperons mean nothing in my young life, Joshua,” she
said. “I’ve been a railroader, associated with all sorts of
men too many years to give room to any old-maid ideas like
that. But I might have known you would be a prude.
About all that you know of life you have learned from
books. Isn’t that true? Now don’t stand there looking
bashful. Throw the leather off ’em and feed and water ’em,
while I dig greasewood roots for a fire. I’m hungry as a
wolf.”</p>

<p>“Your—er—your mother—she approved?”</p>

<p>“About all that she had to remark on the subject was
that you wouldn’t. But I told her I’d make you. Pioneers
can’t afford to observe the stupid niceties of society at
large; they have work to do. Let’s get busy, then. Night’s
coming on.”</p>

<p>“I was only thinking of you,” Joshua defended.</p>

<p>“Don’t, then.”</p>

<p>Joshua, his head in a dizzy whirl over this unexpected
development and the guilty delight it gave him, went at the
unharnessing of his team. Shanty Madge, her hat off and
her sleeves rolled above her elbows, took a mattock from
his wagon and trudged away to the nearest greasewood
bush. By the time that he had attended to the mules she
returned with an armful of roots. She built a fire while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
he took the camp kit from the wagon and sorted out the
grub.</p>

<p>And soon they were once more seated one on either side
of a cheery campfire—but this time Joshua was alone with
the girl of the frizzly bronze-gold hair and the Pocahontas
coloring and the topaz eyes that had brought him West.</p>

<p>As the campers ate their ham and eggs coyotes yodeled
off in the dimly outlined foothills. The camp was by a
foothill spring, where a watering trough had been set up;
and over it tall cottonwoods spread their leafy comfort.
To the east, and slightly below them, the night wind rehearsed
the never finished dramas of the wastelands in the
daggers of the yucca palms. Above them towered the mountains,
the old men of the earth, symbols of wisdom and
understanding, forbidding and grim to those who love them
not, friendly and tolerant to those who do. And over all
lay that uncompromising hush that throttles the souls of
men who cannot think, but which, to those who are masters
of their minds, is like the touch of a mother’s hand at bedtime.</p>

<p>They were silent, these two who sat beside the tiny
greasewood fire. They felt their insignificance and lack of
power, and still were unafraid. The fire was not between
them now, for the Adam had risen to offer the weary mules
more water, and when he returned he sat beside the Eve.
And then, somehow, his arm stole round her and he buried
his lips in her bronze-gold hair.</p>

<p>“Shanty Madge,” he whispered, “I love you.”</p>

<p>“I know it,” said Madge. “But—but I didn’t ride down
here for this. You—you shouldn’t have taken advantage,
Joshua. No other man with your natural refinement would
have taken this situation to broach such a subject. I might
have known. It’s because you’re so—well, I guess innocent
is the word—no, unsophisticated.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>“But this is the first time I’ve been alone with you,” he
pleaded naïvely. “It was the night, and the mountains,
and the desert. They—they made me say it. They told
me that you and I were the only people in the world. What
could I do?... Madge, you love me, don’t you?”</p>

<p>A long silence set in after his words. Unseen bullbats,
sailing about in the air above them, swooped down on luckless
insects and their wings went <i>bur-r-r-r</i>. A frog, coldly
comfortable in the drip under the water trough, croaked
his approbation of all things earthly. A mule, his stomach
stuffed with hay, lay down with a thump, and heaved a
sigh of satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Sometimes I think I do,” said Shanty Madge. “And
then again I think I don’t. All women are like that, I
guess. I—I— Really, Joshua, you shouldn’t have—have
told me that—to-night.”</p>

<p>“I know it,” he replied. “But I couldn’t help it, Madge.
Do you think you’ll love me when you know me better?
I’ve loved you since you were eleven years old. Do you
think you will, Madge?”</p>

<p>“I—perhaps. I think so. I mean I don’t know. You
must—you must take your arm away, Joshua. I’m going
to take my blankets over there on the hillside and go to
bed.”</p>

<p>Obediently he released her and stood erect.</p>

<p>“If you’d only forget your foolish astronomy, Joshua.
I can’t think about—well, about what you just said—until
you do. When I think of your spending two thousand
dollars for that telescope, Joshua, why, I—I’m almost afraid
you’re crazy! I can’t live in the mountains always. I’ve
seen too much of life. I don’t want to hurt your feelings,
but you must make money, dear boy. If we were—well,
now—married, we’d have to have money. And you can’t
make it up there—that is, unless the land proves to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
good, and things turn out all right, and you work your
claim for all that’s in it. There isn’t a living on Spyglass
Mountain, Joshua.”</p>

<p>“Why, I can make a living for us, Madge. I mean to
work my claim, of course. But I can’t give up my astronomy.”</p>

<p>“It will take all of your time,”—her tones were positive.
“And besides, I consider that land only a stepping stone to
something better. I mean to develop it and then sell out
to some one who hadn’t the nerve to pioneer as we intend
to.”</p>

<p>“Does Jack Montgomery want to marry you?” he asked
abruptly.</p>

<p>“Should you have asked that, Joshua? You’re <i>so</i> unsophisticated!”</p>

<p>“Why not?”—his voice was boyishly belligerent.</p>

<p>“Well—he’s asked me to.”</p>

<p>“Do you love him?”</p>

<p>“I don’t like your tone, Joshua!”</p>

<p>“Do you?”</p>

<p>“No! That is, I don’t know. Sometimes I think I do.
If he’d only—well, knock ’em in the collar a little harder.
I can’t tolerate a drone. But he’s promised to go to work
with his father’s company if I’ll—well, you understand,
marry him.”</p>

<p>“You could never love him, Madge.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not. But he can give me what I want.”</p>

<p>“Money, eh?”</p>

<p>“The things money will buy, at any rate. And above
all, he’ll be somebody if he ever puts his mind to something.
He has brains.”</p>

<p>“And I haven’t.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t intimate any such thing, Joshua Cole! You
have more than he has, perhaps, but your mind has a different<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
trend. But his brains are the brains that’ll count in
this world’s struggle. You’re a—a— Now, I don’t want
to hurt you, but you’re a dreamer, Joshua.”</p>

<p>For a long time Joshua proved that he was a dreamer,
for he gazed unseeingly into the dying coals and said not a
word. But when he looked up his lips were straight, and
in his eyes was that look of firm determination that had
kept him true to his trust from boyhood, against all odds.
Yet those grave gray eyes were tolerant and smiling as they
looked at her.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m a dreamer,” he admitted. “And I’m going to
make a dreamer of you, too, Shanty Madge. Listen: Do
you know this one, by John Boyle O’Reilly?</p>

<p>The bronze eyelashes hid the eyes of Shanty Madge as
Joshua’s voice ceased. She looked up presently, to smile
back at him despite herself.</p>

<p>“I know that,” she told him, “and I like it. I—I fight
it—sometimes.”</p>

<p>Joshua turned abruptly to the wagon.</p>

<p>“Which room have you picked for yourself?” he asked.
“Point it out and I’ll carry your bedding there.”</p>

<p>Then suddenly, from close at hand, came the tread of
many hoofs on the rocky road to Ragtown.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVI<br>

<small>THE MORON</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">HAD they not considered themselves so entirely alone
in a vast wilderness, the ears of Shanty Madge and
Cole of Spyglass Mountain long since would have
been acute to the low rumble of California Bill’s heavy six-mule
wagon. But the past few minutes had been tense ones
with these two, and they had heard no sound until the little
hoofs of Bill’s mules left a sandy stretch in the road and
clicked upon the rocks.</p>

<p>Madge and Joshua stood still and listened, and now all
of the sounds that are a part of a heavily laden mountain
wagon on the move were distinguishable—the click of hoofs,
the grumble of the shifting load, the crunch of the six-inch-tired
wheels, the creak of leather, the jingle of harness hardware.
And soon a great bulk hove in sight, growing mysteriously
out of the night like a huge shadowy leviathan
climbing up out of the sea.</p>

<p>There came a hail. California Bill had glimpsed the
twinkle of the campers’ fire.</p>

<p>“By golly, it’s California Bill!” Joshua exclaimed. “I
didn’t know he was behind me. I’ll poke up the fire and
get him something to eat while he’s ’tending to his skates.”</p>

<p>Then he lifted his voice in welcome.</p>

<p>California Bill dexterously swung his straining team out
of the ruts in the road, and, with the cargo swaying perilously
from side to side like a top-heavy tug in a pyramidal
sea, he drew up beside Joshua’s load of lumber, where the
six mules stopped without command and fluttered their pink
nostrils in a “blow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>“Hello, there, Cole of Spyglass Mountain!” came the
cheery greeting from the top of the load. “An’ I’m an
ornery beef critter if Shanty Madge ain’t here, too! Say,
Tony, I learned a new word at Spur to-day. What’s one
o’ these here morons they’re talkin’ about these days?
Fella at Spur called me one, an’ I didn’t know whether to
slap ’im on the wrist or not—an’ that’s what ye might call
an embarrassin’ situation.”</p>

<p>Joshua laughed. “You’re anything but a moron, Bill, so
you should have slapped him. But get off and feed and
water your stock while I throw some ham and eggs in the
pan for you. We’ll talk about morons later.”</p>

<p>“Is it awful bad to be one, Tony?” Bill chuckled as he
clambered down. “I thought this bird thought I was some
kind of a Filipino. I didn’t want to be that, either, but I
didn’t want to show my ignorance. Say, why didn’t ye
wait for me, Tony?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know you were in, or I would.”</p>

<p>“Yes—but I load from cars at the far end o’ town. I
guess that’s why you missed me. They told me you was in
and gone ag’in, and I lit out after ye, two hours behind,
thinkin’ sure my six could overtake those two old chuckawallas
o’ yours.”</p>

<p>“Be careful, Bill!” warned Madge. “These are my
mules, remember.”</p>

<p>“Yes’m, I guess they are. But if ye’ll cast yer yellow
eyes over these here marvels I’m drivin’ ye’ll admit that
‘chuckawallas’ is right.”</p>

<p>“My eyes are not yellow!” retorted Madge.</p>

<p>“They’re tagger eyes, that’s what they are—dangerous
eyes. But quit pickin’ on me, Madge. I was tellin’ Tony
that I hadn’t meant to ramble out till th’ followin’ mornin’,
but when I heard he was on th’ road I says I’ll ketch ’im,
an’ we’ll make the merry pilgrimage together. But I had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
a confoun’ breakdown th’ other side o’ Bobcat Point an’ it
set me back. But I knew ye’d camp here, Tony, so I kep’
th’ shavetails ramblin’. An’ here we are, all <i>hi-yu
skookum</i>!</p>

<p>“But about them moron fellas, Tony?” Bill was busily
engaged in unharnessing his mules while he rattled on, and
Shanty Madge had gone to help him. “Wasn’t it morons
that th’ U. S. soldiers fought in th’ Philippines?—those
boys that swung th’ mean bolos an’ was plumb <i>cultus</i> in a
scrap?”</p>

<p>“Not quite,” Joshua laughed. “The morons are worse
than that, Bill.”</p>

<p>Bill stopped stock-still in the midst of leading his swing
team to the watering trough, and the mules pressed past
him, one on either side, until they were straining toward
the trough at the ends of their lead-ropes.</p>

<p>“I know what they are,” Bill declared with conviction.
“They’re them birds in Utah that have a dozen <i>mujeres</i>
apiece! I never thought o’ that till this confoun’ minute—seems.
And here I ain’t got even one woman to love me.
I sure oughta slapped that Ike! Guess I’ll hook ’im up
an’ go back to Spur an’ ’tend to it.”</p>

<p>“Bill, if you don’t hurry up with those mules and close
that crack in your face I’ll throw this grub in the fire and
go to bed,” warned Joshua.</p>

<p>“Mules,” said Bill, “hear that? No <i>muck-a-muck</i> for
us if we don’t quit our foolin’.” And he loosed the lead
straps, whereupon the mules dispensed with his services
entirely and rushed to the trough, to bury their velvet muzzles
deep in the water and wash out the desert dust.</p>

<p>When Shanty Madge had finished helping California
Bill with his teams she bade the men good-night, and refused
to allow Joshua to carry her bedding to the little nook
she had chosen on the hillside. She tripped away carrying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
on her head a roll of blankets and a single mattress, which
she had packed down on the unridden mule. Joshua sat
down with Bill to keep him company while he ate.</p>

<p>Bill took an enormous mouthful of ham, and nodded at
Joshua’s load of lumber, dimly outlined by the firelight.</p>

<p>“Quite a jag you got,” he said, which is the Western
way of describing a heavily laden wagon and is not designed
to cast reflections on one’s state of insobriety.</p>

<p>But before Joshua could agree with him Bill’s intensely
black eyebrows lifted themselves and a blank look crossed
his face.</p>

<p>“By golly, that reminds me!” he cried. “I’d forgot all
about my passenger till I said th’ word ‘jag.’ He’s on top
o’ my load playin’ with th’ angels—or he was when night
come over th’ desert. Mighta fell off, f’r all I know—he’s
lit from th’ toenails to th’ eyeballs an’ way ports. Ole pal
o’ yours, Tony—this bird they call Th’ Whimperer. He
was at Spur, all het up like an enjine, an’ I gentled ’im
down an’ offered ’im a ride back to Ragtown. Shall I prod
’im off an’ throw a feed into ’im? Guess he must be one
o’ these here morons, but he’s got two legs an’ don’t pick
up his <i>muck-a-muck</i> with his toes.”</p>

<p>“You’ve got The Whimperer on that wagon?”</p>

<p>“If th’ desert wind didn’t blow ’im off.”</p>

<p>“And he’s drunk?”</p>

<p>“Drunk an’ rarin’ to make speech. Talked th’ arm off
me till th’ breakdown th’ other side o’ Bobcat Point, then
he went exhausted an’ pressed hay f’r th’ rest o’ th’ trip.
An’, say, Tony, he was tryin’ to talk about you. Said you
an’ me was friends, an’ he wanted me to make an appointment—seems—f’r
him to meet ye an’ smoke th’ pipe o’
peace. Says he’s got somethin’ to slip ye in th’ way of
information. But I take it he won’t eat. He’s got a bottle
on his hip, an’ he’s hittin’ it to drive th’ sidewinders away<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
whenever he’s awake. Le’s let ’im pound his ear till
mornin’.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I care to see him at all,” mused Joshua.
“He’s heard of the money I got from Demarest, Spruce and
Tillou, and probably wants to slip me a ream or two of
whimpermeter for a touch.”</p>

<p>“Say, you don’t always talk English either, do you?”
chuckled California Bill. “Seems like in this country
every jasper’s got a language of his own. But I’d see this
pelican, Tony. I think he knows somethin’. Ye might find
out who threw that thirty-thirty bullet into ye that
time.”</p>

<p>“Did he tell you anything about that?”</p>

<p>“No; but, as the fella says, he hinted darkly. But
wait’ll mornin’. Le’s spend the rest of our interestin’ conversation
on the subject of morons before we hit th’ hay.”</p>

<p>Joshua laughed as he lighted his pipe at the glowing end
of a twig from the outskirts of the hot ashes.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, “do you know what a bromide is?”</p>

<p>“That ain’t what a fella takes when he’s tryin’ to sober
up, is it?” asked Bill, with a devilish twinkle in his slate-blue
eyes.</p>

<p>“You know I don’t mean that,” Joshua accused.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess I read about th’ kind o’ bromides you
mean somewheres,” Bill admitted. “They say a lot that
somebody’s already said, don’t they?”</p>

<p>“I never heard a more concise definition,” Joshua applauded.
“Well, in an effort to be as concise myself—a
moron is a bromide, only worse.”</p>

<p>Bill pondered deeply, his coal-black eyebrows drawn
down, one stubby digit fingering the iron-gray hair at his
temple.</p>

<p>“A moron,” Joshua amplified, “believes that prohibition
prohibits. He believes what the advertisers of breakfast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
foods have to say about their products, and he makes his
stomach believe it, too.”</p>

<p>Bill nodded understandingly.</p>

<p>“He believes that, if the politician he votes for is elected,
he will get what he longed for when he cast his vote.”</p>

<p>Bill nodded again.</p>

<p>“And,” continued Joshua, “when he doesn’t get it, he
believes he <i>is</i> getting it.”</p>

<p>California Bill allowed himself a chuckle.</p>

<p>“He believes that this country has free speech. He
knows it has because he read an editorial to that effect in his
morning paper. And on the front page of that paper he
read of twenty men being sent to the penitentiary because
they made remarks which, in effect, merely voiced their
dissatisfaction with the accepted order of things and called
for a change.”</p>

<p>“Whoa!” cried Bill. “That’s radicalism! I took some
o’ those birds to th’ pen’ myself.”</p>

<p>“It is not necessarily radicalism,” Joshua denied. “It’s
merely commonsense. We’re not talking politics, remember,
Bill. We’re simply trying to dismember the patient moron
for our own enlightenment.”</p>

<p>“Pump another cartridge into th’ bar’l,” offered Bill.</p>

<p>“A moron believes that the man who doesn’t own an
automobile can’t afford one.</p>

<p>“If he owns a Remington typewriter, there is no other
typewriter on the market worth twenty cents.</p>

<p>“And if his Remington becomes useless because of a fire,
and his grandfather sends him an Underwood to soothe his
soul, no typewriter on the market except the Underwood
is worth twenty cents.”</p>

<p>“I know saddle tramps that are morons,” interjected
Bill. “But, say, Tony, I was jest kiddin’ Shanty Madge
to-night when I said what I did about her mules.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>Joshua’s gray eyes twinkled at this.</p>

<p>“The moron,” he continued, “reads his newspaper from
the first page to the last, but he’ll usually tell you that he
doesn’t care very much for fiction.</p>

<p>“He believes that Christians follow the teachings of
Christ.</p>

<p>“He doesn’t realize that, if Christ came on earth again,
you, maybe, would be called back to Chaparral County to
take him to the penitentiary.</p>

<p>“When he writes a business letter he always begins:
Yours of the ’steenth received and contents noted. In regard
to same will say—</p>

<p>“Bill, I could continue all night dissecting the common,
or garden, variety of moron. Then there’s the highbrow
moron to be dealt with, too. But I haven’t time, and I
think you know what a moron is, anyway. But I’ll add
just one more trait by which you may always know one
when you meet one. A moron is convinced that he is the
only person on earth who isn’t a moron.”</p>

<p>“What’s the population of the United States?” asked
Bill, after a period of thought.</p>

<p>“Something over a hundred million, I believe.”</p>

<p>“Huh!” snorted Bill. “So many as that? But you and
me, Tony, we’re—”</p>

<p>“Look out, Bill! Be careful!”</p>

<p>Bill’s pudgy hand darted to his mouth and covered it in
that boyish gesture which so greatly amused his friend.</p>

<p>“Maybe I am one, after all,” he said, when he dared
remove his hand. “But how’d that bird down there to Spur
get onto it?”</p>

<p>“What happened, Bill?” Joshua questioned him.</p>

<p>“Well, he’s the boss o’ th’ supply deepo down at Spur,
an’s got th’ job o’ buyin’ an’ receivin’ all th’ stuff for
Demarest, Spruce and Tillou, an’ gettin’ it started on its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
way to the camps. He’s one o’ these dapper little fellas,
with a nice white collar on, an’ a gold pencil to figger
with, an’ one o’ these here slim cigarette holders about a
foot long always between his teeth.</p>

<p>“‘What!’ he says to me. ‘D’ye mean to tell me that ye
won’t take two more sacks o’ hams on that load?’</p>

<p>“‘Brother,’ I says kindly, ‘two sacks o’ hams weighs
four hundred pounds, and four hundred pounds is four
hundred pounds too much. I won’t take <i>one</i> more sack.’</p>

<p>“‘An’ I thought you called yourself a mule skinner,’ he
says, with one o’ these here movin’ picture sneers.</p>

<p>“‘In a way,’ I says, ‘I am. These here mules,’ I says,
‘are willin’, pullin’ fools, an’ it’s been whispered that
California Bill c’n handle ’em. I know a load when I see
it. I got it now.’</p>

<p>“‘You’re nothin’ but a joke,’ he says. ‘Why, I myself
know more about mules than you ever dreamed of. You’ll
take two more sacks o’ hams or I’ll fire you.’</p>

<p>“Then I’m up an’ at ’im—seems—all spread out linguistically.
‘Neighbor,’ I says, ‘you didn’t hire me, an’ ye
can’t fire me. Why, you couldn’t fire a cigarette. This
here’s th’ most <i>hi-yu skookum</i> team bustin’ collar-stitchin’
between here an’ Ragtown, an’ I’m th’ most <i>hi-yu skookum</i>
nursemaid to a mule that ever lost a currycomb. I was
skinnin’ mules when yer maw was scoldin’ yer paw f’r not
keepin’ his hand in th’ middle o’ yer back when he walked
th’ floor with ye at night. You don’t know a mule from
a mulley cow. If all th’ mules I’ve wrangled was to stand
a mile away an’ kick in your direction, th’ wind from their
heels would scare you into a cyclone cellar. Why, ye puny
little dude, if ye was to get one whiff of a mule’s collar
after a hard day’s pull ye’d get cholera morbus. If real
mule skinners like me was only gettin’ ten cents a day,’ I
says, ‘you couldn’t get ten cents a month for skinnin’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
peaches in a cannery. Go put on an apron an’ swat flies!
You think a mule’s born with his tail shaved, don’t ye? If
ye had a mule an’ lost ’im on th’ desert, ye’d go out an’
try to run down th’ first jackrabbit ye saw, thinkin’ he was
him. If I was to cut a mule’s ears off,’ I says, ‘an’ tie a
couple o’ them cigarette holders like you got on top his
head, ye’d think he was a ji-raffe who’s maw had forgot to
teach him how to squat behind. There,’ I says, ‘now you
be good, or I’ll crawl up there an’ drag ye down an’ make
ye kiss my off lead mule, then kill th’ mule before he kills
me.’</p>

<p>“An’ as I drives loftily away he begins on me, with his
pink little jowls shakin’ like a pup dyin’ of strychnine
poisonin’, ‘You—you—you—!’</p>

<p>“An’ then I turns an’ looks ’im square in th’ eye an’
kinda pulls in on all six lines. And he finishes:</p>

<p>“‘You—you <i>moron</i>!’</p>

<p>“And, confound ’im, I hadn’t a word to say, ’cause I
didn’t know what he’d called me. Le’s hit th’ hay, Tony—it’s
gettin’ late.”</p>

<small>“NUTTIN’ BUT DE TRUT’”</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WITH California Bill Fox leading—Shanty Madge
beside him on the seat—the two wagons slowly
made the grilling grade up the mountain toward
Ragtown. Beside Cole of Spyglass Mountain rode one who
would have fitted in nicely as “the horrible example” at a
temperance lecture—The Whimperer.</p>

<p>His grotesque face was twisted with remorse and suffering
this morning, and he looked as if he had been on the
rack of torture. His artificial scar was livid, as always,
and about it, as always, grew the scrub jungle of unsightly
beard.</p>

<p>For a long time as Joshua’s four mules strained upward
no word passed between him and his one-time jocker. The
tramp’s bottle was not quite empty, but, a wise and experienced
general in his constant war with booze, The
Whimperer took the remaining contents in widely separated
doses, for Ragtown was still many tiresome miles away.
But finally, after a nerve-renewing dose, the John Yegg
began to croak.</p>

<p>“Jack,” he said, “youse ’n’ me’ve had our little dif’rences,
maybe, in de past, but we better let de dead bury
dere dead—wot?”</p>

<p>“Go ahead,” invited Joshua. “Get it off your chest,
Whimp.”</p>

<p>The tramp sighed wearily, took another dose, held the
bottle before his crooked eyes and surveyed the lowered
contents with a look of agony, and took the proverbial bull
by its proverbial horns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>“Jack, it’s like dis here: I always liked youse, an’—”</p>

<p>“Lay off that stuff,” growled Joshua. “Shoot the
piece!”</p>

<p>“Well den, it’s like dis here, as I said w’en youse interrupted
me: Youse savvy Slim Wolfgang?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know him.”</p>

<p>“Course youse do. Well, Jack, dis here big Slim Wolfgang
he’s a no-good son-of-a-gun—no foolin’. W’en I foist
met up wid dat plug I t’o’t he was all to de <i>bueno</i>, but
nuttin’ doin’. Jack, dat boid is nuttin’ but a dirty crook.”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“Well, dat’s dat, den. Now, Jack, I never stole yer look-see—”</p>

<p>“Who accused you?”</p>

<p>“Well—now—I t’o’t maybe, seein’ youse didn’t savvy
who did glom ’er, dat maybe youse t’o’t I did.”</p>

<p>“Look here, Whimperer,” said Joshua sternly, “you get
down to business or get off and walk. I know you stole my
telescope, so that ends it. Now tell your story and quit
beating about the bush. I’m in no humor to monkey with
you this morning. If I make you get off and walk you’ll
suffer all the tortures of the damned before you reach
Ragtown. Now come through—and tell the truth—or hit
the gravel.”</p>

<p>“Jack, youse wouldn’t do dat to an old pal like—”</p>

<p>“Old pal be damned! Come across, or off you go!”</p>

<p>The Whimperer, pondered, reached for his bottle, thought
better of it, and relaxed with a sigh of misery.</p>

<p>“Well, here she is, den,” he began. “An’ I’m givin’ it
to youse straight, de whole trut’ an’ nuttin’ but de trut’—swelpmeGawd!</p>

<p>“Jack, I did swipe de look-see, an’ I peddled ’er for a
hunnerd bucks.”</p>

<p>Cole of Spyglass Mountain groaned aloud.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>“An’ dat’s how come it dis big Slim Wolfgang lost youse—see?
I beat it an’ lost de bot’ o’ youse togedder— See?”</p>

<p>“What d’ye mean by that?”</p>

<p>“Well, dis Slim Wolfgang, I know um ever since he come
from de kid-pen, back East somew’eres—w’ere de bot’ o’
youse was in stir togedder—see? Dat is, I meets um a
little after dey sprung um, an’ he was on de road, a tramp
like me. An’ I snared um f’r me road-kid, an’ him an’ me
beat it a lot togedder.”</p>

<p>Then The Whimperer went on to tell, in his rambling,
haphazard way, how Slim Wolfgang had trailed Joshua out
of Hathaway, had chanced to meet him—The Whimperer—on
the road, and had hired him to help in keeping watch on
the amateur hobo. It had been quite easy thus to keep
Joshua always under surveillance; and at last Joshua realized
why it had been so difficult to evade The Whimperer.</p>

<p>“But he wouldn’t spring it wot it was all about,” the
tramp complained. “An’ dough he had a roll dat woulda
choked a horse, he wouldn’t pungle up enough. He jes’
kep’ promisin’ an’ promisin’ dat I’d get mine someday in
a lump, an’ he wouldn’t spring de dope. So as t’ings didn’t
look good to me, I swipes de look-see w’en youse tol’ me
wot she was wort’—an’ I trun up de job. To dis day,
Jack, I don’t savvy w’y Slim Wolfgang keeps on yer trail.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Joshua, after long reflection, “how does it
come that you and Slim are together again at Ragtown?
Are you still working for him at watching me?”</p>

<p>“I am, Jack—dat’s de point. I was down in Louisiany
in a jungle camp long after I’d ditched youse, and all of a
sudden in comes dis here big Slim Wolfgang an’ grabs me
by de t’roat. He pretty near choked de life outa me, and
I’m gonta get um f’r dat one o’ dese here days. But dat’s
neider here der dere. De big point is dat he says he’s got
track o’ youse ag’in, an’ knows w’ere youse’re at An’ he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
says he’ll still gi’me a chanct to make dat big piece o’
money if I’ll go wid um to Ragtown, out in Cal, an’ keep
me eyes on youse. He don’t wanta stick aroun’ Ragtown—see?
Back in Hat’away he’s got a swell dame—see?—and
nuttin’ doin’ f’r her in de Golden West. So Slim he wants
de kale dat he’ll get f’r keepin’ his lamps on youse, but he
don’t wanta do de woik. Get me? So he hires me ag’in, an’
slips me a piece o’ jack.</p>

<p>“Well, we beats it West togedder on de cushions—see?
An’ we go to Ragtown. An’ youse’re woikin’ f’r Demarest,
Spruce an’ Tillou. So Slim he’s gonta leave me dere
to lamp youse an’ write um ever’ now an’ den w’edder
youse’re stickin’ er not. An’ he was gonta beat it back to
his jane until he saw wot good pickin’s dere was at Ragtown.
Slim’s a good stud-dealer, an’ de railroad stiffs had
a lotta jack. He didn’t know it was gonta be like dat w’en
we started from Louisiany. So he wires his jane wot a good
field dere is at Ragtown f’r him an’ a pretty, wise dame
like she is, an’ she gets hep to herself an’ beats it out.
She’s one o’ de dancehall goils at De Golden Eagle, w’ere
Slim deals stud an’ c’n keep his eye on her. Dey’re grabbin’
off de jack, de bot’ of ’em—believe me! So he’s dere
pipin’ youse off, an’— Well, he tied de can to me, de no-good
son-of-a-gun! I’ll get um someday, Jack—no foolin’!
An’ dere I was broke, an’ him refusin’ to pungle up any
more jack. An’ w’en I tried de skeleton dance at Ragtown
to get me a little piece o’ coin f’r meself, an’ youse lamped
me an’ chased me t’rough Slim’s tent, de no-good son-of-a-gun
beat me up somet’in’ fierce f’r woikin’ me graft on de
street an’ gettin’ caught. So I’m off um f’r life. He t’inks
he’s got me buffaloed, but I ain’t scared of um—so I’m
springin’ wot I know on youse. An’ dat’s all, except dat
I’m broke an’ need a piece o’ change. If youse’ll slip me a
hundred bucks, Joshua, I’ll beat it outa de country. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
was on me way w’en I was at Spur. But dere was a big
cowpunch in dere blowin’ to de gang, an’ I gets cuckoo an’
t’inks I’ll make it back an’ slip youse wot I know—an’
maybe youse’ll treat me right f’r ole-times’ sake. Dere she
is, Jack.”</p>

<p>“Now let me get all this straight,” mused Joshua. “In
the first place, how did Slim Wolfgang get track of me
again?”</p>

<p>“Dat I can’t say—he wouldn’t spring it.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, how did he get track of you in Louisiana?”</p>

<p>“Dat would be easy, Tony—”</p>

<p>“Don’t call me that!”</p>

<p>“Well, seein’s I’m wot youse might call a prominent
character on de road, any ole-time yegg could tell Slim
about w’ere to fin’ me. An’ he’d ast dis one an’ dat one
as he rambled along, an’ pretty soon he’d meet up wid a
yegg who could steer um right to me.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s true,” Joshua agreed. “But why does Slim
Wolfgang want to keep in touch with me?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t I tell youse he wouldn’t tell me dat? But I’m
tellin’ youse he’s gettin’ paid f’r it, Jack; an’ one o’ dese
days, he tol’ me, he’s gonta get a big fat roll f’r wot he’s
done. Dat’s wot I was supposed to wait for. He’d a beat
me outa mine, I’m bettin’!”</p>

<p>“When?”</p>

<p>“I can’t tell youse dat.”</p>

<p>Joshua sat looking at the tails of his wheelers for a long
time, then suddenly he burst out laughing. The thought
that anybody on earth would pay anybody else to trail <i>him</i>
over the country struck him as about the most ridiculous
thing he had ever heard. But The Whimperer’s story had
the ring of truth.</p>

<p>“Did Slim Wolfgang shoot me?” Joshua fired at the
yegg so suddenly that he jumped with surprise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>“Well—now—er—”</p>

<p>“Tell me!”</p>

<p>“Jack, I—”</p>

<p>“Spit it out, damn you, or I’ll—”</p>

<p>The fingers that threatened The Whimperer’s prickly
throat had clasped a striking hammer for several months,
and the bare brown arm back of them looked to the old
tramp like a copper cylinder, bulged in two places by internal
explosions.</p>

<p>“He—he done it, Jack. He tried to croak youse!”</p>

<p>“Were you along?”</p>

<p>“No. But I know he done it. He had a thoity-thoity
rifle in his tent f’r a week before it happened, an’ den
afterwards she wasn’t dere no more. He’d borried it to
hunt deer wid, he said.”</p>

<p>“Why does he want to kill me?”</p>

<p>“So’s his job’ll be over an’ he c’n get de jack dat’s comin’
to um. It’s up to um to keep youse put, it looks like, till
a coitain time. Den he’ll get de kale. Well, if youse’re
croaked, youse’re put, ain’t youse? No foolin’! An’ Slim
an’ his jane have got a bunch o’ coin on ’em now dat dey
made at Ragtown rollin’ de suckers. De moll wants to beat
it East an’ get herself some furs an’ di’mon’s an’ t’ings.
An’ Slim an’ me’s on de outs—see?—so no one c’n watch
youse but him. An’ he’s sick of his job. But now dat he’s
tried to croak youse he’s scared to let any one else in on
de deal. It’s one t’ing to hire a guy to lamp anudder one,
an’ anudder t’ing to hire um to have anyt’ing to do wid
murder. An’ anudder t’ing: Since youse got dat big jack
from Demarest, Spruce an’ Tillou, he’s scared youse’ll be
beatin’ it East yerself any day. He don’t savvy wot
youse’re gonta do wid dat coin, an’ he’s worried.”</p>

<p>“The idea, then,” remarked Joshua, “seems to be to prevent
me from going East.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>“Dat’s de way I dope her out, Jack.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll be perverse and go East and find out what
it’s all about,” Joshua declared.</p>

<p>“Take me wid youse, ol’-timer!” pleaded The Whimperer.
“I c’n steer youse to Slim’s hangouts back dere,
an’ maybe de bot’ of us put togedder c’n get de dope.
I’m scared to hang aroun’ now dat I’ve sprung meself.
Dat Slim Wolfgang’s a killer. Youse won’t squeal on me,
will youse, Jack?”</p>

<p>“I’ll protect you,” Joshua promised. “And we’ll call it
square between you and me regarding the theft of the
telescope. But there it must end. I can’t afford to take
you East.”</p>

<p>“Den slip me a little piece o’ jack, an’ I’ll hit de stage
out o’ Ragtown to-morrow an’ take to de road again. Honest,
Jack, I’m scared o’ dat plug!”</p>

<p>“I thought you told me that you weren’t.”</p>

<p>“Well I am an’ I ain’t—see? I fight in de open, meself.
He’s a dago fighter, dat no-good son-of-a-gun! Dat’s w’y
I’m scared of um—see? Get me, Jack?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I get you, Whimp. I’ve had you for many moons.
Now have you told me all you know?”</p>

<p>“Dere’s jes’ one t’ing more,” replied the John Yegg.
“But before I spring her, won’t youse promise to slip
me—”</p>

<p>“I’ll give you ten bucks,” said Joshua, “and not one
cent more. That’ll get you to Spur and give you two-fifty
to go on the road with. You’ve traveled a thousand miles
on less.”</p>

<p>“But, Jack—”</p>

<p>“Shut up! I know you! Not another penny. Take it
or leave it—and I’ll make you tell me everything you know
about this business whether you accept or decline.”</p>

<p>“Jack, youse’re crool!” the panhandler reproached.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>“I’m worse than that,” Joshua told him, and extended
a ten-dollar bill.</p>

<p>With a sigh of resignation the tramp clutched it in his
talons.</p>

<p>“This is stage day,” Joshua reminded him. “The stage
will pass us about ten o’clock, I imagine. Then you can
swing off and get aboard.”</p>

<p>“But I’ll get de rats before I get to Spur,” wailed The
Whimperer. “I gotta go on to Ragtown an’—”</p>

<p>“I’ve a pint flask under the seat cushion,” Joshua told
him. “It’s yours when we sight the stage. Now get busy
and tell me the whole of it.”</p>

<p>“Jack, gi’me dat flask now an’—”</p>

<p>“Say, you talk and talk fast or—” Once more those
long brown fingers writhed in and out, and The Whimperer
began speaking rapidly.</p>

<p>“Well, dere ain’t much more to tell. But keep yer eye
on dat boid dey call Lee Sweet, Jack—de cowpunch. Watch
dat boid, I’m tellin’ youse. I seen Slim let dat guy get
away with a stack o’ De Golden Eagle’s money apoipoise.
I seen Slim’s whole card, an’ Slim knew as well as I did
dat he had dis Lee Sweet beat. But he lets Sweet take de
pot, an’ after dat dey’re t’ick as mud. Dat’s dat.</p>

<p>“An’ de only udder t’ing is dis here: Slim’s been tellin’
all over Ragtown dat youse was Number Fifty-six Thoity-five
in a kid-pen back East, an’ tryin’ to make out youse’re
a bad actor all aroun’—see? An’ ever’ time dis big Lee
Sweet gets a snoot-full in De Silver Dollar he tells de worl’
he’s gonta get youse. Den Slim Wolfgang he grins. Dat’s
all, Jack. Honest to Gawd! An’ f’r de sake of de good ole
times de bot’ of us had togedder I hope youse win!”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” drawled Joshua in mock politeness.</p>

<p>Two hours later they sighted the stage from Ragtown to
Spur winding about the hairpin curves above them. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
half an hour later The Whimperer eagerly clutched the
flask of snakebite remedy, and the weird old John Yegg
boarded the stage and became only a bitter memory in the
life of Cole of Spyglass Mountain.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVIII<br>

<small>“YOU’LL COME BACK TO SPYGLASS MOUNTAIN”</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WINNIE THE WEEPER was not the least attractive
of the girls who were attached to The
Golden Eagle at Ragtown for the purpose of
separating the railroad stiffs from their hard-earned money.
She was dark-eyed and dark-haired and of a good figure.
She danced well, and was able to put up a painted pout that
made men part with their money and believe themselves in
luck. When the pout failed, she had the gift of causing
tears to spurt from her dark eyes, and then men longed to
make her smile once more, and only money could make
her smile. Hence “Winnie the Weeper” was the underworld
“monaker” of Slim Wolfgang’s girl.</p>

<p>It was evening, three days after Cole of Spyglass Mountain
had hauled his load of lumber to the homesteads and
set to work with nails and hammer. The stage reached Ragtown,
and Winnie left her place behind the chair of Slim
Wolfgang in The Golden Eagle, where she had been watching
a desultory game of stud between Slim and one of his
cappers. The revel of the night was not yet on, and Slim
had asked her—ordered her, rather—to see if any mail had
come for them on the stage.</p>

<p>She left The Golden Eagle and passed along the street
toward The Silver Dollar, a few doors distant. The darting
glances of several stiffs lounging about the doorways
followed her as she tripped along, singing softly. For The
Weeper was a “dresser,” and she carried herself with
pride. There was about her, also, an air of “something
better,” even though she did chew gum too rapidly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>In five minutes she was back in The Golden Eagle and
handing Slim a dirty letter.</p>

<p>Slim laid his cards on the table, and, without excusing
himself to his dummy antagonist at stud, tore open the
envelope and frowned in puzzlement at the contents.</p>

<p>Then he spoke shortly to his capper.</p>

<p>“Deal ’em out, Johnny,” he said. “I’ll send Nick in to
cap for youse. C’mon, Win; I wanta show youse
sumpin.”</p>

<p>Dutifully the girl followed him out, and they walked
together to the tent through which Joshua Cole had chased
The Whimperer.</p>

<p>Inside they sat down on the bed.</p>

<p>“Read dat, will youse?” offered the gambler, and angrily
thrust the letter into Winnie’s hand.</p>

<p>She read as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Slim Wolfgang</span>:</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sir.</span> i have quit you slim as your a no good sun of a gun
an somday im going to get you for the roten way you treted me.
I saw cole an told him all i know about you an the son of a gun
was tight an would not give me anything much to beet it on.
just the same slim he told me something that youd like to know
mity well. You wont cetch me because im gone from you old
timer. But if you want to know what i got from cole you send
twenty five dollars to me in the care of mother duffy at the oakland
bar in sacermento. then ill slip you what i know. goodby
you big stiff. ill get you somday.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">the Whimperer.</span>”</p>
</div>

<p>The envelope was postmarked “Spur, California,” and
the date was the day before.</p>

<p>“Well, for the love of Mike!” gasped Winnie the Weeper.
“What’re you goin’ to do about it, Slim?”</p>

<p>Slim rested his cadaverous chin in one bony hand and
meditatively ran the long nicotine-stained fingers of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
other hand up and down over the six golden buttons on his
billiard-top vest.</p>

<p>“Aw,” he husked finally, “he’s tryin’ to string me.
Maybe he played stool pigeon to Cole, all right, but he don’t
know nuttin’ to tell. I was too wise to let um know anyt’ing—see?
But what would Cole be tellin’ him that would
be any use to me, kid?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” mused the girl. “Looks to me like the
big stiff’s got somethin’ to peddle, Slim. He didn’t make
any promises—none o’ this big honest-to-God business.
Just said ‘lay ’er down,’ like he meant business. I’d take
a chance, Slim. You threw the fear of Christ into that
tramp, and he wouldn’t dare double-cross you by holdin’
out on you after you’d sent the jack. He’ll remember how
easy you located him before. And what’s twenty-five—to
us?”</p>

<p>Slim Wolfgang’s thin sandy eyebrows drew lower, and
his leering, gangster’s face was not good to see. “I gotta
take a chance,” he decided finally. “So you get a money-order,
kid, an’ do like dat dam’ —— says. He’s got me;
an’, as youse said, wot’s twenty-five? Slip us a kiss,
now, kid, an’ I’ll be gettin’ back to de game. Dey oughta
be driftin’ in pretty soon. Oh, hell, I’d like to beat it outa
here after next payday!”</p>

<p>“Here, too,” sighed Winnie. “God, I got more jack
than I ever saw before, an’ it’s goin’ to waste in this rotten
hole. Say, if we was in N’ York, Slim—”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know—I’ve heard dat spiel before. But we ain’t
dere, an’ we can’t go dere till dis business is off me han’s.
Beat it, now, an’ send dat jack like De Whimperer says.
An’ if he’s tryin’ to make a sucker outa me, by God he’d
better ramble some!”</p>

<p>Ten days later Winnie the Weeper and Slim held between
them a dirty scrap of paper, on which was penciled:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>“cole told me he was going east to see what it was al about
that i told him about.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">the Whimperer.</span>”</p>
</div>

<p>“Goin’ East, is he? Goin’ East, hey!” growled Slim, as
the girl looked expectantly up into his pale-blue eyes.
“Well, he’ll not go East, take it from me, kid! Now I
know wot to do. An’ I’ll do it, too! But no East for us,
Win, until spring—that settles that. I was thinkin’ maybe
Tony was settled over dere on his claim an’ you an’ me
could beat it as soon as winter set in an’ take a chance.
But De Whimperer has spilt de beans—an’ now Tony’s
t’inkin’ he’ll beat it East. Oh, wait’ll I get me mitts on
De Whimperer!”</p>

<p>“You—you won’t kill Cole, then, Slim? That means
you won’t, don’t it? Slim, I—I don’t like that kinda
business. I may be a sportin’ girl and a crook, and all that,
but I couldn’t stand to have you bump that guy off.”</p>

<p>“No, I won’t bump um,” Slim promised. “But if I
don’t it means we gotta winter it out here in these dam’
mountains, Win. An’ stay clear up till the fifteent’ of
June.”</p>

<p>“I guess I’d rather do that, Slim,” she told him, “than
have you bump a guy off. But, God, I’m sick o’ this hick
country!”</p>

<p>“All right, kiddo—youse’re de doctor. But Cole won’t
go East—take dat from me! I know how to stop um!”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Shanty Madge was adorable in overalls and a carpenter’s
apron with nail pockets in it. And on the right leg of her
overalls was a stout band of self material, as the garment
advertisers would say, in which to hang her hammer when
she used a saw or other tool. The hammer hung pretty
low and was bothersomely heavy, but Madge used the strap<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
religiously. But she told Joshua in confidence that pins
tasted better in the mouth than nails.</p>

<p>It is to be feared that the true reason for the repeatedly
hammered thumbnail of Cole of Spyglass Mountain was not
due to awkwardness but to the captivating companionship
of his helper.</p>

<p>Fall was manifest in the air. Fleecy clouds hung over
the mountains, and there was an exhilarating nip in the
kiss of the wind from Stirrup Lake. Frost covered the
ground of mornings, and Joshua was afraid to accept the
dare of Shanty Madge to touch his tongue to the steel of
the tools. Wild ducks were circling high over the lake, for
the water grasses were full ripe now and drew mallards and
canvasbacks and pintails from afar. Old Man Winter was
not far distant, and they worked early and late to outmaneuver
him.</p>

<p>They completed the cabin and the stable of the Mundys
first. Then they went at Joshua’s cabin at the foot of
Spyglass Mountain. The work was kept back by Joshua’s
having to leave and haul more building materials, and on
one trip in he found that his telescope had arrived by
freight. The thousand pounds that it represented, when
added to a load of lumber, made the lumber content of
that load pretty light. But Cole of Spyglass Mountain was
a boy with a new toy. Nothing would do but that he should
uncrate his treasure and set it up on its pedestal in his
half-completed cabin, which served very well as an observatory
then because the roof was not yet on.</p>

<p>Madge was as enthusiastic as he was, and after a hard
day’s work with saw and hammer she was not too tired to
spend hours of the night with Joshua looking at the
heavenly bodies, crowing with delight.</p>

<p>It was a wonderful telescope. The tube was approximately
ten feet long, and the pedestal was of iron. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
was a clock attachment which automatically moved the
instrument so that it would follow a stellar body across
the sky without the attention of the operator. There was a
finder, of course, and once the image was settled upon
Joshua had nothing to do but give his every faculty to
observation.</p>

<p>Winter was almost upon them by the time Joshua’s
cabin and stable were up. Then Joshua hauled lumber and
metal roofing for his observatory. This he was obliged to
leave at the foot of Spyglass Mountain while he worked
at the continuation of his trail to the summit.</p>

<p>Madge had decided to put a team at work clearing the
sagebrush—dragging it down with a length of railroad steel
which she had used for like purposes on the grade. Then,
too, there was the winter’s wood to be cut and hauled.
And before the spring drive of the Box-R cattle into the
mountains, the homesteads must be fenced. It seemed that
there were a million things that should be done at once
in order to gain time, but Madge discarded all of them and
helped Joshua build his trail.</p>

<p>No amount of argument on his part would change her
mind. One look at the marvels of the skies through the
new telescope seemed to have fevered her with the desire to
get the materials for building the observatory to the top
of Spyglass Mountain at the earliest possible date. So
Joshua compromised with her, and they felled trees and
hauled them to the cabins during the crisp mornings and
hacked at the trail to the top of Spyglass Mountain during
the mellow afternoons.</p>

<p>They made the trail no wider than necessary for a tandem
team to pull a narrow sled up the steep side. The mountain
rose so abruptly from the gentle slope above the lake that
they were obliged to switch back and forth, make hairpin
curves and buttonhook bends, and twist in and out about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
great gaunt rocks and clusters of scrubby piñon pines.
Spyglass Mountain was perhaps a thousand feet above the
level of the lake, and a bench mark that Joshua had discovered
hidden away in the sage showed that the lake was
about six thousand seven hundred and fifty feet above the
sea. So the telescope, when installed for work on the summit,
would be at an altitude of approximately seven thousand
seven hundred and fifty feet. The mountain was
bleak and rugged and dry, for it overlooked the desert and
was under the influence of the desert rather than the
moister country on the coast side of the range. It was a
huge, steep pile of rocks and red-quartz outcroppings, with
low piñons, sage, a few junipers, and an occasional yucca
palm to tone down its grimness, and render its coloring contrasty
when the sun so willed. But to Cole of Spyglass
Mountain it was the most wonderful spot on earth!</p>

<p>Snow was flying before the trail had been completed, but
this did not deter the workers. They were nearing the
summit now, where the snow did not lie in drifts as it did
down by the lake. Then, the high winds which arose drove
it from the top and sides in fleecy puffs. This aided the
work, but it worried Joshua. An observer cannot expect
“good seeing” when the atmosphere is disturbed by gales.
But the high winds, he had been told, were usually confined
to the winter months in that locality, so the young astronomer
was by turns elated and depressed.</p>

<p>Joshua had given up all thought of going East to try and
solve the mystery of Felix Wolfgang’s long-distance persecution.
He had been impulsive when he informed The
Whimperer that he would do so, knowing when he spoke that
it would be folly for him to leave the mountains when so
many things demanded his immediate attention. Besides,
he would not have left Madge and her mother to prepare
for the coming of a mountain winter with no man about to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
help them. Most of their neighbor homesteaders had left
the country as soon as the skies showed blustery clouds and
squalls began to scurry over the lake. And the three had
only a speaking acquaintance with the few who had resolved
to brave the winter through. He was too busy,
even, to give Felix Wolfgang much thought—too happy with
Shanty Madge in daylight hours, and with the precious telescope,
dimly outlined in a corner of the cabin, through
moonlit nights.</p>

<p>Late one afternoon they finished the trail, laid down
their picks and shovels, and stood side by side looking
down on the wind-swept desert four thousand feet below
them, stretching away in three directions, an awe-inspiring
sight under the mystic spell of the fleeting winter afternoon.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it glorious!” Madge exclaimed. “I feel like a
bird. Like an eagle. If I had wings that I could lift, and
could soar away over that tantalizing yellow waste, away
over those calico buttes far to the east that seem to be
calling me, I—I— Well, I’d just lift ’em and soar, that’s
all.”</p>

<p>“And where would you end?” asked Cole of Spyglass
Mountain softly.</p>

<p>“I’d never end, I guess. I’d keep on soaring forever.”</p>

<p>“And never come back to Spyglass Mountain?”</p>

<p>“Well, when I wanted to rest and lay my plans for
another soar, perhaps.”</p>

<p>“I’d be here waiting for you,” he told her significantly.</p>

<p>“Would you? Keeper of my home port of the skies? If
I could soar away, east and west and north and south, I
think I’d like to keep this pinnacle in mind. I would become
confused, perhaps, and lose my bearings. Then I
could turn and head for Spyglass Mountain again, which
seems to me to overlook the earth and sky. And you’d be
here to correct my course for me and point out where I had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
missed the way. Then I’d rearrange my ruffled feathers and
try once more; and you’d watch me through your telescope
until I’d be only a tiny speck a thousand miles away.
Oh, this is silly, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Madge,” he said, and his tone trembled, “I want you
never to forget what you’ve just said. It isn’t silly. If
Spyglass Mountain turns out to be the ideal place for
astronomical observations, I shall always be here—always,
that is, as human beings speak of always in connection with
their brief lives. You may soar away—something tells me
that you will. But remember—I’ll always be here waiting
for your return.</p>

<p>“Dear girl, you don’t want money—you don’t want life,
as most folks speak of life. You were born for the outdoors,
for the freedom that it offers. You have never tasted
the artificialities of life in the cities, and therefore you
think you want to. But if you go you’ll come back as
straight as the crow flies—back to the mountains and the
deserts and the places where quiet reigns. It’s born in
you, and you can’t escape it. You’ll come back to Spyglass
Mountain!”</p>

<p>“How do you know that, Joshua?”</p>

<p>“It’s easily explained: Never have I heard from you a
murmur of discontent over the solitude of these vast mountains.
Like myself, you are one who can be alone for days
at a time, with the bleak peaks about you or the mocking
sandy wastes of the desert, and be content with only them
and your thoughts for company. We are rare, Madge.
Such an unanswering solitude as would drive many people
insane, we thrive on. I say we are rare. I mean that a
man and a woman who both possess that quality rarely
meet each other and—and fall in love. That is—I mean, of
course— Well, I love <i>you</i>; I’ve told you so. And you
should forget everything else and let yourself love me.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
You can’t afford to take chances by letting yourself love
another man, who might take you to the cities, where you
imagine you want to go. For as sure as spring follows
winter Spyglass Mountain will call you back. And then—if
<i>he</i> doesn’t want to come?</p>

<p>“What if a night on the desert, with the moaning of
the wind in the greasewood bushes and the half-mournful,
half-mocking laugh of the coyote, strikes terror to his heart?
What if the constant roar of a waterfall gets on his nerves
instead of soothing him to sleep, as it would soothe you and
me? And <i>you</i> must have these things. So one of you must
sacrifice to the very core of your being—and that means a
life of suffering and discontent for the one who is biggest
of heart and gives in to the other. And that one, Shanty
Madge, will be you.”</p>

<p>“And how do you know that, O sage?”</p>

<p>“Listen: Because those who are born to the open spaces,
those who love the unanswering solitudes and are at peace
with God and Mother Earth—they are always the ones who
make the sacrifice. Because their souls are big like the
mountains—their vision is wide like the desert—their courage
is like the rocks—their hearts are kind and sheltering
like the trees. Yes—like the trees! The great-hearted trees
that shelter men for ages, and then go down before man’s
ax with one long groan of anguish, surrendering everything!”</p>

<p>With her bare head bowed, and the winter wind whipping
her crinkly bronze-gold hair, the little gypo queen stood
listening. And in her eyes, as she lifted them to his, a
miragelike moisture gleamed. She took his hand.</p>

<p>“Let’s go down, my poet-astronomer,” she said. “We
must get a good sleep to-night and be up early. It will be
a long, hard job to sled the lumber for our observatory to
the top of Spyglass Mountain.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIX<br>

<small>WINTER IN THE SAN ANTONES</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE observatory was completed and the telescope
sledded to the top of Spyglass Mountain and installed
early in the month of January. Winter had
set in in earnest, and there was six feet of snow on the
gentle slopes about Stirrup Lake. But the homesteaders’
new cabins were snug and tight; they had an abundance of
fuel and provisions; so the mountain storms that danced
up in fury from the lake and shook the structures to their
scant foundations had few terrors for them.</p>

<p>Joshua was so successful in the building of his observatory,
with its conical, revolving metal dome, that he wrote
an article, entitled “A Home-made Observatory for $300,”
and sent it to <i>The Universe</i>. He had carefully followed instructions
in the author’s article that he had among his
notes, and had improved on the plans and specifications.
It was a proud day when he rode home on Argo from
Ragtown and showed Madge his check for twenty-five
dollars from <i>The Universe</i>.</p>

<p>He had bought a second-hand typewriter, and of evenings,
while the building of the observatory was under way, had
applied himself to authorship with that tireless energy
which already had carried him so far in his studies. And
the following spring his article, “Speculations on the
Physiology and Anatomy of the Inhabitants of Mars,”
which was published in <i>The American Astronomer</i>, brought
him many letters from interested readers, and some of them
were men well known in scientific circles. Joshua received<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
only ten dollars for this contribution, but if his check had
been for a thousand it could not have given him the pleasure
that the letters did. The editors of the magazine commented
at length upon the freshness of his work and asked
to see more of it, with the result that they accepted, before
the publication of his first paper, “Fissures or Canals?—A
Study of the Surface Features of Mars,” and “The
Atmosphere of Mars.” Then the editor of <i>The Journal
of Astronomy</i> wrote to him and asked him to submit something.
After the rejection of two of his articles, “Is Mars
a Lifeless Planet?” was accepted; and a check for fifty
dollars sent him galloping to Madge on Argo, waving the
strip of blue paper like the banner of a conquering hero,
as he saw her looking out the window.</p>

<p>Before “Is Mars a Lifeless Planet?” was in press Joshua
received a telegram, days late because of the snowdrifts in
the mountain gaps that had retarded the mail stage, asking
for a companion article of about four thousand words
telling who he was, where he had been educated, and describing
his work in telescopy. At Ragtown Joshua met
California Bill, in from one of his freighting trips, when
he received the belated message. California was the more
enthusiastic of the two, for Joshua had the true student’s
reticence about blowing his own horn.</p>

<p>“Tell ’em all about it, Tony,” urged Bill. “Lay it on
thick. Lord, I wish I could write! I’d do it for ye, my
son, an’ I’d do ’er <i>hi-yu skookum</i>! An’ don’t forget to say
that, out here, ye’re known as Cole of Spyglass Mountain.
That’s yer trade-mark. I give it to ye, an’, by golly, ye
gotta use it! Go home an’ tell ’em how th’ war broke out.”</p>

<p>So in a whimsical mood Joshua took his friend’s advice.
He made it quite clear that he had no degree, even explaining
that he had never been to college. He lauded to
the skies his boyhood friend, Beaver Clegg, and credited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
him with any success that he—Joshua—might have
achieved. He told about his life in the House of Refuge,
about his days as a tramp, about Ragtown and the new
railroad, and how he had earned the money to buy his
telescope and settle on a homestead. He hinted at the idea
of the inhabitants of Mars trying to communicate with the
earth through the medium of canals laid out in the form of
a geometrical figure. He told of Spyglass Mountain and
his observatory, and his difficulties in sledding the instrument
to the summit. And last of all, to please California
Bill, he mentioned that he was known in the community as
Cole of Spyglass Mountain.</p>

<p>He gave his brief autobiography no title, and when it
appeared in print, preceding his article “Is Mars a Lifeless
Planet?” in the March issue of <i>The Journal of
Astronomy</i>, California Bill’s chest bulged out with pride;
for the editor had entitled it “Cole of Spyglass Mountain.”</p>

<p><i>The Scientist</i>, a New York publication, was editorially
opposed to the theory that Mars is inhabited, and they took
occasion to draw Joshua over the live coals in their May
issue. They admitted that his speculations were interesting,
and that they were set forth with grace and power,
but they laughed to scorn all of his ideas. They ridiculed
his youth and inexperience, and made no bones about throwing
in his teeth the fact that he had no reputation whatever
as an astronomer and had the stamp of no institution’s
approval upon him. The writer was vituperative and insulting,
but he did Joshua more good than harm for the
reason that <i>The Scientific Weekly</i> took up the controversy
in support of him, with the result that “Cole of Spyglass
Mountain” became a well-known name among the devotees
of science.</p>

<p>And thus it came about that when Joshua’s great night
arrived his name was fairly well established, and the scientific<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
world was ready to weigh his words and give his conclusions
serious thought.</p>

<p>By spring Ragtown was reading science. Joshua had
become an object of mild ridicule before his first article
appeared. Then as the press-agent work of California Bill
began spreading the news that Cole of Spyglass Mountain
was in print, Ragtown awoke to the realization that they
had a celebrity in their midst. He was looked at in awe
as he rode in on Argo, with his silvered tapaderos flapping
and his bridle-reins a-jingle, sometimes with Shanty Madge
beside him on her black. And when winter broke Ragtown
made pilgrimage to Spyglass Mountain to see the telescope
and view the heavens through its powerful lenses.</p>

<p>But there were two who did not come—Lee Sweet, the
cattleman, and Felix Wolfgang, the gambler. And it was
known to Joshua that his old enemy of the House of Refuge
was still at Ragtown, and that Lee Sweet rode up often
from the desert and stayed for days, carousing in The
Golden Eagle. Once Joshua came face to face with him in
the post office. Sweet glowered at him, swung about on
his heel, and dragged his spurs into the barroom.</p>

<p>As spring approached Joshua’s work in the observatory
was kept back by the high winds that prevailed, which
caused such atmospherical disturbances as to make his patient
vigils at the eye-piece a waste of time. To study Mars
under these conditions was impossible, even though his
telescope was a Brashear and an exceptionally fine instrument
to boot. So when atmospheric conditions were at all
favorable he devoted his attention to study of the surface
of the moon, and to recording the rise and fall in the luminosity
of certain variable stars whose exact minimum and
maximum periods were not yet fully established. But his
chief interest during this period of poor seeing was the
search for vegetation on the floors of certain lunar craters,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
which had often been reported by well-known astronomers.</p>

<p>Patient vigil was also kept in the case of the marvelous
craters of Alphonsus and Eratosthenes. On the floor of
Eratosthenes, eight thousand feet below the level of the
surrounding Sea of Showers, he at last caught a glimpse
of what he believed to be the long-sought indications of
vegetable growth. In the northern part of the crater-floor
a peculiar spot became noticeable soon after the sunlight
began to flood this area. Within fifty-six hours the spot had
expanded in two winglike regions, and forty-eight hours
afterward it had disappeared.</p>

<p>He reported these discoveries to the Milton University, to
be recorded and published for the benefit of other students.</p>

<p>It was during this period that Joshua took up the study
of optical physics. Beginning his studies with the few
classical treaties he had among his books, he soon was
wholly absorbed in the mysteries of lens-making, crystallography,
stellar photography, the tele-microscope, and
other modern developments along similar lines of research
and experiment. So he ordered by mail copies of any works
which might have been published during the past three
years by authorities on any of these phases of his study,
leaving the matter of selection to the discretion of a well-known
New York dealer in works of science. Also he
bought a number of tools and a diverse assortment of materials
for experimental purposes.</p>

<p>Although he had come into possession of a telescope of
remarkable defining power, owing to the superior quality
of its object glass, he realized that its light-getting power
was unequal to the task of showing fine detail on so distant
a body as Mars. So, with his new tools and material and
his added knowledge to aid him, he set bravely to work to
devise some means of increasing the power of his telescope
by some kind of accessory apparatus, applied either to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
object glass or to the eye-piece. Some such instrument
already had been invented and was then in use for special
research work on the stars. Why should he not be able to
work out some device of equal or even greater efficiency for
observation of the planets—especially Mars?</p>

<p>During the winter months, then, he acquired, with indefatigable
application, all of the information available on the
subject of his investigations. On this solid theoretical foundation
he made experiment after experiment, seeking always
to discover some type, quality, or combination of lenses,
color screens, or other apparatus that would bring him
nearer his goal. Some improvement was finally effected,
but the advantage gained was not equal to his requirements.
Though somewhat discouraged by the meager results,
Joshua persevered, often going so far as to make attempts
contrary to the principles laid down in the advanced textbooks
he had read. In such efforts, however, it seemed that
he always failed to advance his cause. But he realized that
ultimate success lay in breaking new ground. No mere improvements
on existing instruments could serve his purpose.
He must explore new regions, devise a new method, just as
so many tenacious pioneers had done before him.</p>

<p>To describe the many devices employed by him would
form a tedious narrative, comprehensible only to a thoroughgoing
student of optical physics. But before spring
arrived he had succeeded in constructing an instrument
which, attached to the eye-end of the telescope, projected a
greatly enlarged image of Mars on an adjacent screen. Or
by employment of a suitable color screen laid over his object
lens, a camera system could be used, photographing the
enlarged image, which then could be studied at leisure.
This was a decided advantage, for clear images of the
planet’s surface, even with the newly devised accessory instrument,
were obtainable only during brief moments of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
atmospheric quietude. Consequently his hopes soared high.</p>

<p>And now Joshua was ready for the momentous day in
June, when he hoped to make the great discovery which
would prove to the scientific world that there was active,
intelligent life on the planet Mars.</p>

<p>Shanty Madge had been his close companion throughout
the winter months. Often of clear nights she climbed with
him to the summit of Spyglass Mountain, where she sat
by the little air-tight heater and read or sewed while he
worked at his various problems. The operations of Montgomery
and Applegate had ceased for the winter, and Jack
Montgomery was out of the mountains, so that Madge saw
nothing of him at all. Often she and Joshua rode horseback
together, exploring the remote parts of the valley and
its surrounding hills and cañons. Together they went on
snowshoes to Ragtown for the mail, Joshua ahead and
breaking trail, Madge keeping the pace with the customary
vigor of her splendid youth.</p>

<p>Then the long winter broke, and the ice gave up its grip
on the lake with explosive lamentations. The saltgrass
showed a tinge of green, and tiny starlike flowers modestly
showed their faces here and there. Then Shanty Madge
hooked up a team and began plowing and building fence,
with the keen spring wind on her Indian cheeks. And as
the winds made astronomical observations next to useless,
and since he was not required to do any work on his homestead
for six months or more to come, Cole of Spyglass
Mountain decided to go East and unravel the mystery that
surrounded him. Also he wished to try and make up with
his brother Lester, whom he still loved with that rare devotion
that he was capable of. If Lester was not doing well,
he hoped to persuade him to return with him to California
and throw in his lot with him on the homestead.</p>

<p>But at this point Felix Wolfgang took a hand.</p>

<small>SLIM WOLFGANG PLANS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN Cole of Spyglass Mountain made no move
to go East, following The Whimperer’s warning,
Slim Wolfgang’s indignation rode high.
Of course he imagined that the crafty old John Yegg had
“played him for a sucker,” and he recounted to Winnie
the Weeper all of the terrible things that he meant to do
to him if their paths should cross again. Then when his
resentment threatened chronic indigestion Slim’s girl overheard
Joshua telling the postmaster that he would be leaving
for the Atlantic seaboard sometime near the last of
April.</p>

<p>Joshua and Shanty Madge had ridden in that evening
for the mail and a few supplies. When they entered that
part of The Silver Dollar which was devoted to the post
office, Winnie the Weeper was standing in the archway between
the store and post office and the barroom. Her dark
eyes were fixed on Lee Sweet, the cattleman, who was at
the bar in a state of imbecile intoxication. When opportunity
offered, Winnie the Weeper had been keeping her
eyes on Sweet a great deal of late, when he was not in The
Golden Eagle in company with Slim. And thus it came
about that she was near enough to overhear Joshua’s
remark.</p>

<p>She promptly glided away through the barroom, unseen
by Madge and Joshua. She snarled at a drunken railroad
stiff who grabbed playfully at her in the doorway, slipped
out, and hurried down the street to The Golden Eagle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>Ragtown’s liveliest hours were represented in The Golden
Eagle. Dozens of men were crowding before the plain pine
bar, as many more were dancing with the highly painted,
short-skirted girls, and the gambling tables were not idle.
In the far end of the place was a lunch counter, before
which, on high stools, sat men and girls, and the odor of
frying meat filled the room.</p>

<p>Again the girl evaded intoxicated admirers and pushed
her way through the throng to the stud game. Here Slim
Wolfgang officiated, with a green-celluloid eyeshade pulled
low on his forehead, his long, slender fingers deftly manipulating
the pasteboards.</p>

<p>He frowned as Winnie leaned over his shoulder and
whispered that she had news for him. He glanced at his
watch. Then, stating that it was time for him to eat, he
turned his chair over to an associate and followed the
girl to the lunch counter.</p>

<p>They found two vacant stools and sat side by side, while
Winnie repeated in low tones the conversation that she had
overheard.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Slim with a sigh, “dat means we gotta get
busy, kid. Tony Cole ain’t goin’ East, and dat’s dat.
How’s Sweet to-night?”</p>

<p>“Lit to the eyeballs,” Winnie told him.</p>

<p>“Well, den, we’ll eat an’ drift outa here. I’ll go to
me tent, an’ youse try an’ steer Sweet in dere as soon as
youse can. Get me? We gotta do some talkin’.”</p>

<p>“But what’ll I tell ’im, Slim?”</p>

<p>“Tell um anyt’ing to snare um. Tell um I wanta see um
a minute. It won’t do f’r me to be seen shuntin’ um
aroun’. Youse gotta do it.”</p>

<p>Winnie’s order of pork chops had been set before her,
and she ate nibblingly, silent, her eyes on her plate.</p>

<p>“Slim,” she said at last, “I think it’s about time you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
was slippin’ me the dope. I’m off this stuff o’ workin’ in
the dark. You promised me there’d be somethin’ big in
this deal for me, but you never told me what you was gonta
do nor what it’s all about. You wouldn’t trust The Whimperer,
and now he’s gone and left you. And you won’t
trust me. And I think you’d ought to, Slim. Ain’t I
always played square? Then why do you keep me outa
the know? I wanta know what I’m up against before I
go any farther.”</p>

<p>“Look here, kid,” Slim husked, with a frown of annoyance:
“I ain’t de kind dat spills everyt’ing, even to my best
girl. When it’s all over, an’ we got de jack, youse’ll know
all about it. So what’s de use youse knowin’ now?”</p>

<p>“I want to, anyway; I don’t see why you don’t trust
me, Slim.”</p>

<p>“It ain’t dat, Win. I do trust youse. But dat’s a way
I got. I keep me mout’ shut—see? I guess I got dat way
in de reform school—I know I did. We had a way dere
o’ moochin’ ’round like a lotta mice an’ sayin’ nuttin’
about our business, ’cause we never savvied who was gonta
squeal on us. So dat’s de way it is wid me, an’—”</p>

<p>“But I don’t work that way,” Winnie the Weeper interrupted.
“If you’re gonta lay up with me, Slim, you gotta
come across with everything. I don’t keep nothin’ from
you, kid—and you gotta do the same with me. And I’m
tellin’ you right here that I wanta know what all this
funny business is about, or I won’t have anything more to
do with it. That’s me, old kid! And you can take it or
leave it!”</p>

<p>“Gettin’ funny, ain’t youse?”</p>

<p>“Well, you heard what I said. If you don’t trust me,
how’m I gonta trust you? How do I know there’ll be
anything in it for me, after I’ve gone along and done what
you told me to? How do I know you won’t grab off the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
jack and leave me somewhere talkin’ to myself? No—nothin’
doin’. It’s time for a showdown.”</p>

<p>Slim idled with his knife, the frown still covering his
brow. “Well,” he announced suddenly, “let’s finish eatin’
an’ den we’ll go to de tent an’ I’ll tell youse all about
it. Maybe youse’re right, kid, but I always like to keep
me dope to meself.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right when you’re workin’ alone,” Winnie
conceded. “But when you’ve got a pal in on the deal with
you, you oughta come clean. I’ll admit I don’t trust you—and
that’s been just the reason.”</p>

<p>“Why, kid, I wouldn’t toin youse down. Youse know
youse’re de only jane on de line dat’s got me goat.”</p>

<p>“That’s what they all say,” sniffed Winnie.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll prove it, den—I’ll slip youse de dope.”</p>

<p>“All right,” Winnie said demurely, and her dark eyes
sparkled over her conquest.</p>

<p>A little later they sat together in the tent, one on either
side of the rickety table, with a candle flickering between
them. Slim sat thoughtfully silent for a little, his brown-paper
cigarette pasted with saliva to his lower lip and hanging
lifelessly. His pale-blue eyes stared into space. The
affected huskiness was gone from his voice when he began
to speak, for, being a practiced habit, it deserted him in his
more serious moments.</p>

<p>“Well, here she is,” he started in, “an’ I ain’t keepin’
nuttin’ back. An’ youse’ll say it’s good, w’en youse know
dere’s gonta be twenty-five t’ousan’ to split between us.
Does dat sound good, kid?”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh,” murmured the girl, edging her chair closer
to the table and resting her round, smooth chin in both
hands. “Go on, Slim. Spill it.”</p>

<p>“Well, it begun jes’ a little w’ile after dey sprung me
from de House of Refuge—see? I’m runnin’ de pool tables<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
in Carlo’s Place, down on Nort’ Street, in Hat’away.
Youse savvy de dump.”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh—sure I do.”</p>

<p>“Well, one afternoon a plug drifts in an’ watches de
games a little, den w’en I’m settin’ up de balls after a
couple o’ guys gets t’rough playin’, dis boid sidles over an’
braces me. He asts me if I don’t want a drink an’ a lotta
bunk like dat, an’ I’m on right away he’s got sumpin’ on
his chest. He’s wearin’ de rags—see?—an’ he looks like
money. So I drift wid um, an’ we go to De White House
Saloon an’ set in a boot’.</p>

<p>“Well, finally he springs it dat he savvies who I am—see?
An’ he knows I jes’ was sprung from de House of
Refuge. An’ he asts me if I ain’t de guy dat Number
Fifty-six thoity-five had a scrap wid dere. Dat’s Tony,
youse know—dat was his number. I tell um yes.</p>

<p>“Den he monkeys aroun’ a little, not sayin’ much of anyt’ing,
an’ finally he comes across wid de dope dat he’s
Tony’s ole man. His name’s John Cole—see?—an’ I’ll tell
de worl’ he’s some interested in his kid!</p>

<p>“An’ finally we get down to business, an’ he springs
de dope. An’ it’s like dis here:</p>

<p>“W’en Tony’s mudder croaked dey let Tony go home
from de House of Refuge. An’ w’ile he was dere he meets
an’ ole uncle he’s never seen before. He’s his mudder’s
brudder—see? Dis ole boid’s got a lotta jack. An’ de
family dat Tony’s mudder belonged to wouldn’t have nuttin’
to do wid her w’ile she’s alive because she hooked
up wid dis Cole. He’s a sport an’ a gambler, it looks like,
an’ dey’re off um f’r life. But w’en Tony’s mudder
croaked dey all come to de funeral an’ was nice as pie.
An’ dis ole uncle comes an’ takes a shine to Tony.</p>

<p>“But he’s a funny ole gink—half nuts, I got it—an’ he
goes away all of a sudden, an’ don’t say nuttin’ to nobody.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
He was gonta get Tony outa de House of Refuge, an’ dis
an’ dat an’ de udder t’ing, an’ jes’ raise hell generally.
But he seems to ferget all about it, an’ beats it widout even
tellin’ Tony good-by.</p>

<p>“Well, Tony goes back to de House of Refuge an’ fergets
all about um, I guess. But before Tony gets sprung dis ole
guy gets sick an’ t’inks he’s gonta croak. He’s got a lotta
jack, an’ w’en he makes out his will he leaves a hundred an’
fifty thou’ to Tony, an’ Tony was to get it w’en he got to
be twenty-one.</p>

<p>“We had an ole nut in de House of Refuge named Beaver
Clegg. He’s de boid dat put dis star-gazin’ racket in
Tony’s head. Him an’ Tony was t’ick as mud all de time
Tony was dere, before Clegg bumped off. Well, it seems dis
ole Clegg had went to dis ole Peter Henry Florence—dat
was de name of Tony’s uncle—an’ tol’ um wot a fine boid
dis big Tony was. Tol’ um he was studyin’ dis big astronomy,
or wotever youse call it, an’ tol’ um Tony was gonta
make a good one some day. An’ he hands de ole uncle a
lotta bunk like dat, an’ de ole plug falls for it w’en Clegg
tells us Tony’ll need money to keep up dis star-gazin’ w’en
dey spring um from de kid-pen. An’ de ole man makes a
will leavin’ Tony a hundred an’ fifty thousan’ cold, but he
can’t get it till he’s twenty-one. An’ dey say dey’ll keep it
dark from Tony f’r fear he’ll lay back an’ rest pretty till
he gets his mitts on dat coin. An’ if Tony dies before he’s
twenty-one, de jack goes to de younger brudder dat dey
calls Lester. He done dat because he’s sorry he’d treated
his sister like he’d done all dose years, an’ wanted to do
sumpin’ for her kids.</p>

<p>“Well, somehow Tony an’ Lester’s dad gets onta de deal.
He hates Tony, an’ knows if Tony gets de jack he won’t
see a cent of it. But de kid brudder is diff’rent. Ole Man
Cole knows he c’n win’ Lester aroun’ his finger an’ take de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
coin away from um, like he done wid his mudder. So he
tells Lester about it, an’ tells um to give Tony de merry
ha-ha w’en dey spring um. An’ de ole man plans to put
Tony outa business someway until Lester c’n get de jack.</p>

<p>“An’ so Tony’s jes’ come out w’en Ole Man Cole comes
to me, an’ Lester’s give um de cold shoulder. An’ Tony
tells Lester he’s goin’ West dat very night. Tony ain’t of
age yet, an’ Ole Man Cole wants to know w’ere he is every
moment o’ de time; so Tony’s gotta get lost someway, or
else somebody’s gotta bump um off.</p>

<p>“Well, Ole Man Cole ain’t any too keen f’r bumpin’ off
his own kid, but I guess he’d woik umself up to it if de
woist come to de woist, ’cause he was ’way in de hole from
playin’ de ponies an’ chasin’ ’round wid wil’ women. But
everyt’ing looks jake w’en Tony says he’s gonta beat it
West. Jes’ de same, Ole Man Cole wants somebody on his
trail until he’s of age, to see dat he don’t flop up in
Hat’away again an’ spill de beans. So he says he’s hoid
about me in de reports he got from de House of Refuge—dey
tol’ about Tony an’ me’s scrap an’ all—an’ he’s
looked me up since dey sprung me an’ savvies I’m a crook.
An’ he says I’m jes’ de guy to keep after Tony an’ see
dat he don’t come back to Hat’away, an’ he’ll gi’me five
thou’ to see dat Tony don’t show up until after he’s twenty-one.</p>

<p>“Well, w’en dere’s a hundred an’ fifty thousan’ comin’
to <i>him</i>, youse c’n bet yer sweet life he can’t talk to Slim
Wolfgang about any five thousan’. So we go down in a
clinch, an’ w’en we come up he’s offered me fifteen thousan’
if I’ll guarantee to keep Tony away. An’ we settle
on dat basis, an’ he slips me a piece o’ jack in advance an’
tells me Tony’s beatin’ it dat night, an’ for me to get after
um right away.</p>

<p>“So I get into me road clothes an’ shadow Tony from his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
brudder’s room w’en he starts out wid dat dam’-fool telescope
over his shoulder. De nut! An’ I gets De Whimperer
to help me w’en I meets um on de road, an’ we gets
along well until dat bum spills de beans by swipin’ Tony’s
telescope an’ beatin’ it. An’ den I lose Tony on account o’
dat, an’ I beat it back to Hat’away.</p>

<p>“An’ Ole Man Cole is mighty sore, an’ says he won’t
pungle up anudder cent—’cause he ain’t got it, for one
t’ing,—until it toins out dat Tony don’t come back before
he’s twenty-one.</p>

<p>“Den one day de old uncle comes to Hat’away an’ fin’s
out dat Tony’s been sprung an’ hit de trail. An’ it’s only
a few days before Tony’s twenty-first birthday—see? An’
Ole Man Cole’s all swelled up, t’inkin’ dat now Lester’ll get
de jack—w’ich means dat <i>he’ll</i> get it umself finally—an’
den de ole uncle gives um de udder barrel. He says he’s
goin’ to his lawyers an’ change de will so dat it gives Tony
de jack if he’s found before Lester’s twenty-first birthday.
If not, den de jack goes to Lester, like de foist will read.</p>

<p>“Well, Ole Man Cole’s scared stiff again dat Tony’ll
show up some day before Lester’s twenty-one. An’ de guys
dat he owes money to are after um hot an’ heavy. An’
neider of us savvies w’ere Tony is. An’ den old Peter
Henry Florence he croaks, an’ everyt’ing’s in de han’s of
his executors. An’ den one day Lester gets a letter from
Tony tellin’ um dat he’s in Ragtown, out here in Cal,
an’ askin’ um to send his books an’ t’ings to um by express.</p>

<p>“So now Ole Man Cole an’ me know w’ere Tony is, an’
everyt’ing’s jake again, ’cause ole Florence is dead an’ de
will can’t be changed. An’ I make Cole promise to cough
up twenty-five thousan’ if I’ll go to Ragtown an’ see dat
Tony stays dere. So I look up De Whimperer an’ we beat
it out. An’—well, Tony’s still here, an’ his brudder’s
twenty-first birt’day is de fifteent’ of next June. We gotta<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
stay till den, kid, or we won’t get de jack. An’ now Tony’s
t’inkin’ he’ll go back to Hat’away, is he? Well, he won’t—take
it from me! Nuttin’ doin’, if I have to— Well, youse
savvy wot happened once, Win, w’en youse got to beefin’
about stayin’ in Ragtown any longer.”</p>

<p>“Slim, did you shoot Tony to—to kill him, so that we
could go East?” asked Winnie the Weeper in a low,
strained voice.</p>

<p>“Well, youse’re claimin’ I don’t love youse, ain’t youse?
Youse wanted to go East, an’ dere wasn’t any udder way
dat I could beat it wid youse, was dere? Dat’s love, ain’t
it, kid? I don’t wanta croak a guy any more dan youse do.
But I wasn’t gonta lose dat big money if I could help it.
Anyway, de dam’ fool didn’t croak, so I hadta talk youse
into stickin’ again by promisin’ youse half o’ dis big money
w’en I got it. An’ youse fell for it—an’ now youse’ve got
all de dope. But Tony’s goin’ East, he says, an’ in two
mont’s de time’ll be up an’ he’ll lose de money. Lord, I
was scared w’en he begun to have t’ings printed in dese here
nut magazines. I t’ought sure ole Peter Henry’s lawyers
would see his name an’ fin’ out w’ere he was. But dey
didn’t—I guess nobody but nuts reads dem magazines.
But if Tony’s name ever gets in de newspoipers—good
night!”</p>

<p>“And how’re you gonta keep him here till the fifteenth
of June?” asked Winnie. “What’s to keep ’im from
beatin’ it the last o’ this month, like he said he was gonta
do?”</p>

<p>“I got a frien’ dat’s gonta do dat little t’ing for me,”
Slim assured her. “Go make goo-goo eyes at Lee Sweet
an’ steer um in here, Win. He’s de boid dat’ll do our
woik for us. I been pretty good to um ever since I knew
he was sore at Tony on account o’ dat big homestead racket.
I been tellin’ um all about Tony’s bein’ in de House of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
Refuge, an’ a bad acter an’ all—but a coward—see? An’
he gets to t’inkin’, every time he gets drunk, dat it’s his
dooty to de community to run Tony out. I’ll tell um dat
if he puts de skids under Tony, de rest o’ de homesteaders
will get scared an’ beat it. Lee’s got a bunch o’ cowpunchers
dat’ll get a big kick outa tryin’ to t’row a scare
into Tony—dey’re a wil’ bunch. Tony won’t scare, but
dey don’t know dat. Get me? Let de udder fella woik f’r
youse, kid, ever’ time youse get a chance.”</p>

<p>“But we don’t want Tony run out,” protested the girl.
“Then he’d sure go East, wouldn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Say, youse don’t get de big idea at all, kid. Youse
don’t know Tony Cole like I do. Jes’ start to run dat
boid anywhere an’ watch um stick! De harder youse
fight dat boid, de harder he fights back. An’ he’s stuck on
dat homestead an’ his ole fool mountain, ain’t he? If he
lets Sweet run um out, he loses de land, don’t he? Let
Sweet get after um once an’ try to give um de run, an’
watch dat Tony stick an’ fight um! Somebody may get
croaked, but it won’t be me! Now get me right, kid—I
ain’t got no use for dis here Tony Cole. But dere’s jes’
one t’ing I’ll say for um—he’s a fightin’ fool.”</p>

<p>“Slim,” said the girl, “I got an idea that’ll let us go
East right now, and make more money besides. Double-cross
Cole’s father and tell Tony all about it—but first make
Tony promise to give you fifty thousand, and—”</p>

<p>“An’ youse’ve got anudder guess comin’, Win. De
Whimperer woulda done jes’ dat, if I’d tol’ um all I
knew. D’youse see, now, w’y I keep me mout’ shut?”</p>

<p>“But you—”</p>

<p>“Listen, kid,” the gambler interrupted, “I wouldn’t let
Fifty-six thoity-five get dat jack for <i>half</i>. I hate um like
a terrier hates a rat—an’ now’s me chance to get um! Get
me, kid?”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXI<br>

<small>BULLETS FROM SPYGLASS MOUNTAIN</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IF Joshua Cole had not fully decided on his trip East
while the seeing was poor on Spyglass Mountain, what
Shanty Madge told him when he talked over his plan
with her made an added reason for going.</p>

<p>She rode to his cabin door one morning, crinkly bronze-gold
hair outstanding in the breeze, chromatic cheeks aglow.
Joshua was busy with his books, but Madge was one disturbance
always to be tolerated.</p>

<p>“Hello, kid astronomer,” she greeted him. “Get your
nose out of that book and come out here and talk to me.”</p>

<p>He obeyed the preëmptory command, glad as a dog that
answers its mistress’ call.</p>

<p>“Not working this morning?”</p>

<p>“No, I’m sick of work. Get Argo and let’s go for a
ride.”</p>

<p>Joshua decided that he too was sick of work, and followed
Madge to the lakeside with his saddle on his back.</p>

<p>Despite the capricious mood that the girl had assumed,
it seemed to Joshua that she had something serious on her
mind this morning. She had nothing at all to say while
he threw his saddle on the gray’s back and cinched it.
She was silent, too, after he had mounted and they were
galloping around the lake toward G-string.</p>

<p>“Let’s slow ’em down and find out what’s troubling
you,” he suggested finally.</p>

<p>She reined in promptly, and their ponies followed the
water’s edge at the cow-pony walking-trot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>“You’ve really made up your mind to go East?” she
asked, after a brief continuance of her silence.</p>

<p>“I don’t know when I’ll have a better opportunity,” he
replied. “The seeing on the mountain is rotten because
of these high spring winds. I have lots of time to get at the
work on my claim. I’ve got money—later maybe I’ll not
have. I’m mighty curious to solve the mystery that seems
to surround me. And I want to see my brother and bring
him back, if he’s not doing well and wants to come. Many
good excuses for going right now. I’ll stay only a couple
of weeks, or three maybe, and be back in plenty of time
for the big night in June. I’ll just turn Argo loose to pick
up his living about the lake. You’ll slant an eye at him
occasionally, won’t you?”</p>

<p>For nearly half a minute Shanty Madge was mute.
Then, not looking at her companion, she said:</p>

<p>“But I can’t look out for Argo for you. I—I’m afraid
Ma and I won’t be here.”</p>

<p>“Won’t be here?”</p>

<p>“Yes—we’ve decided to go to Los Angeles for a time.
One of the homesteaders, Mr. Smiley—I guess you’ve met
him—will be glad to hire the mules for his spring work.
So we—so Ma and I thought we’d go.”</p>

<p>“But I thought you were so anxious to get ahead with
your plowing!”</p>

<p>“There’s lots of time. I’ll not seed anything this year,
anyway. And you must remember that <i>you’ve</i> done nothing
much but build a cabin on <i>your</i> claim.”</p>

<p>“That part’s all right,” Joshua conceded. “But knowing
your keenness to be up and doing, I’m a little surprised
at the suddenness of this idea. What is the big idea, anyway,
Madge?”</p>

<p>“Well,” she answered, “Ma and I were in these mountains
long before you were, and I at least have not been out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
once since we came. I thought that while you were away
would be a good time to go.”</p>

<p>Joshua glowed within. Her words implied that if he were
not there she would be lonesome.</p>

<p>“And besides, Ma and I want to buy some things.”</p>

<p>“I can haul anything special that you want from Spur,”
he suggested. He had suddenly remembered that Jack
Montgomery was still in Los Angeles.</p>

<p>“You could carry in under your arm what Ma and I
want to get,” she informed him. “And besides, a man
could never buy them—and you wouldn’t find them at
Spur. You don’t know much about women, poet-astronomer.
We get more fun out of buying things, or merely
just pawing over them on the counters, and getting all
fussed up with indecision over what we’d better choose,
than any man can imagine. And then usually we buy the
wrong thing and have to exchange it—and get more thrills.”</p>

<p>Another silence fell. Throughout its duration Madge
looked across the sunny waters of the lake. Then she suddenly
turned her reddish-brown eyes on Joshua and told the
truth.</p>

<p>“I had a letter from Mary Montgomery last mail day.
She has invited us down. She’s Jack’s only sister and
doesn’t care for camp life. But we like her, and she likes
us. And—and we’ve decided to accept her invitation.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” breathed Joshua. And after a lengthy pause: “Is—is
Jack going to be in camp this spring?”</p>

<p>“Not very much, Mary wrote. He’s no keener for camp
life than she is. He lives with his mother and sister in a
swell apartment in the city.”</p>

<p>“A swell apartment, huh? Madge, I don’t like that word
swell. I don’t know that I ever heard you use it before.
It sounds like— Well, you reminded me of a restaurant
cashier after a night of joy-riding—that’s all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>“Precious lot you know about joy-riding and restaurant
cashiers! You read that in some story.”</p>

<p>Joshua’s heart was filled with bitterness, but it did not
show in his tolerant dark-gray eyes as he studied her
averted face.</p>

<p>“Well, I can’t hold you,” he said at last. “When are
you going?”</p>

<p>“To-morrow—on the stage.”</p>

<p>“Oh, to-morrow!”</p>

<p>“Yes. We—I hadn’t much chance to tell you before
to-day.”</p>

<p>“No—not much”—from Joshua, absently. A space of
silence, then: “Let’s let ’em out a little.”</p>

<p>As they galloped along knee to knee Joshua’s dullness
continued to grow. Had Madge showed him the letter from
Mary Montgomery, or told him of its contents earlier, he
would not have suffered such forebodings. He had been to
the post office with her on the foregoing mail day. She
had read the letter before mounting the black for the ride
back home. She had not even told him who the letter was
from. He even would not have felt miserable over the fact
that it was the Montgomerys who had invited her and that
she was to be under the same roof with Jack down there,
had she made the announcement in her usual buoyant way.
But she had been secretive, and his were the pangs that the
jealous lover suffers mutely.</p>

<p>They swung away from the road as it swept up to the
little mining community of G-string. Piñon slopes, gentle
at first, that followed one another in graduated scallops
until they became a series of steep ridges, led the way to
Spyglass Mountain. Over and about these the riders traced
a course, traveling parallel to the route that they had come,
but a mile inland from the lake. This was a round that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
they frequently made because of the diversity of the scenery
offered. Here and there they crossed tiny hidden grassy
spots, where only bunchgrass grew, unsuccored by any
moisture save that which remained from the winter snows.
Now they rode ridges and looked down cañons that were
amazingly steep and grim, which sprawled eventually to the
yellow desert nearly three-quarters of a mile below them.
Sagebrush slopes, rubble slides, piñon groves, yucca-studded
levels; an eminence where they paused their ponies and
gazed for many minutes over an endless sweep of dark-green
forest to the west; another summit which gave view of
the mocking yellow desert stretching to the north and
south, and bounded on the east by hazy pink buttes that
seemed to float a quarter of their height above the earth; up
and down, over rocky hills and into wedge-shaped cañons,
until a steep slope before them became a flung-out apron
that invited them to climb Spyglass Mountain, towering
above its neighbor peaks—all this was offered them on that
round by the Master of that untarnished land.</p>

<p>And as they reached the hem of the apron and looked
up into the grim old lady’s face they saw a body of horsemen
winding about among clumps of sage and rocky obstacles.</p>

<p>They were Lee Sweet and four of his cowhands; and they
stopped their horses on a shelf that overlooked the cabins
of the Mundys and Joshua Cole, and sat looking down the
mountain’s side.</p>

<p>Then one of them dismounted. There was no mistaking
the gigantic body, the half-moon of ropelike whiskers, the
black Columbia-shape Stetson, or the green-and-purple
plaid of the flannel shirt. Lee Sweet stood by his horse’s
side a moment or two, apparently talking, and then a rifle,
butt up, crept above the horse’s neck as Sweet pulled it
from its scabbard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>“Let’s try to hide,” said Joshua calmly. “We’re about
to learn something, I think.”</p>

<p>There was no cover close. Indeed, it seemed remarkable
that the horsemen above had not seen Madge and Joshua,
but apparently they had not. The two swung about and
sought the obscurity of a clump of yuccas perhaps a hundred
feet away, but before they reached it they heard the
bark of a rifle, and the echoes went galloping off on the
other side of Spyglass Mountain.</p>

<p>They looked back. Lee Sweet was sitting flat on the
ground, his left elbow resting on his knee, the rifle aimed
down the mountainside. Then the two rounded the yucca
clump and left their saddles, to steal back through the trees
and watch. And as they looked out Sweet’s rifle spoke
again.</p>

<p>The vaqueros who accompanied him had moved their
ponies farther back from the shelf, leading their employer’s
animal. Only Sweet remained, and now Joshua and Madge
saw that a scant screen of sagebrush probably hid him from
any one who might be below. Again there came a thin puff
of smoke, and a third bullet went whistling to the lowlands.</p>

<p>Shanty Madge’s face was white, but she had said nothing
since the discovery of the cowmen. Cole of Spyglass Mountain
leaned against the rough trunk of a yucca, his neck
craned around it. Madge saw the spasmodic inflation and
deflation of his thin Grecian nostrils, and his gray-blue eyes
were intense. But in them was no sign of fear or hatred.
His thin, long-fingered hand against the yucca palm was as
steady as if it were caressing the tube of the telescope on
Spyglass Mountain. And the wraith of a smile, tolerant,
whimsical, had settled upon his lips.</p>

<p>“Sweet knows,” he at last observed in his ordinary tones,
“that the chances are fifty to one I’m not in my cabin.
He can see that Argo is not on his picket rope down by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
lake. He also must have noted that your horse is gone.
He knows we ride together a lot. He’s just putting a few
bullet holes through my cabin roof to warn me, I imagine.
What a big, overgrown, innocent child he is! I wonder if
he’s drunk—California Bill says he’s mild as a rabbit when
he’s sober.”</p>

<p>“But suppose you were in your cabin,” said Madge, her
tones rather tense. “That would be a little serious,
wouldn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Well, if he hit me it would be.”</p>

<p>“It seems to me you’re pretty calm about this, Joshua.
Here you have me as a witness that Sweet fired three times— There’s
another shot! You and I have seen Sweet fire four
shots in the direction of your cabin. He has threatened to
run you out of the mountains. What will you do if, when
we get back, you find bullet holes in your roof?”</p>

<p>“What would <i>you</i> do?” asked Joshua, smiling at her.</p>

<p>“I’d have him arrested for attempt to kill.”</p>

<p>“But I know he’s not trying to kill me. He’s almost
sure I’m not there. He even may have seen you and me
ride away this morning, and was waiting until he was sure
we were far in the hills before putting on this little act.”</p>

<p>“Well, isn’t it a grave misdemeanor, to say the least?”</p>

<p>“Rather, I should say.”</p>

<p>“Well, then! Aren’t you going to do anything about
it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think I shall,” Joshua chuckled. “I think I’ll
tell California Bill on him.”</p>

<p>“Joshua Cole,” said Madge, with lips drawn straight,
“is it possible that you are a coward?”</p>

<p>Joshua seemed to deliberate over his answer. “No,” he
told her seriously, “I don’t believe I am, Madge. Why?
Do you think I’m one?”</p>

<p>“When you were shot,” she reminded him, “you made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
no move whatever to find out who waylaid you. You allowed
that tramp, The Whimperer, to bully you and steal
your most priceless treasure. And when you found him at
Ragtown you let him go scot-free. You know in your heart
as well as I do that Slim Wolfgang shot you—and he’s at
large. It seems to me that you’re entirely too easy-going—a
little bit <i>too</i> long-suffering. I’ve never seen you mad.
I’ve never heard you cuss a horse or a mule—or even speak
an impetuous word to them. Sometimes I admire your restraint;
but just now I am beginning to wonder if— Well,
I’m wondering whether you have any masculine traits
at all—if you have any pep in you, which is so necessary to
holding one’s own in this world—so necessary to success.”</p>

<p>He regarded her gravely, the distant rifleman for the
time forgotten.</p>

<p>“Yes, I have masculine traits,” he assured her. “For
one thing, I love you devotedly. But, Madge, a student
hasn’t time to fight. Misunderstandings, petty wranglings—such
things—interrupt his studies. How could I concentrate
if I had always on my mind some puny difficulty
with my fellowman, which in the end amounts to nothing?
My astronomy is the big thing in my life. Everything must
give way before that—everything must be sacrificed to that.
I must, and will, give up everything else for that.”</p>

<p>“Would you give up me?”</p>

<p>“I’ve already done so, haven’t I, dear?” he asked softly.
“If I had accepted Demarest’s offer after I stopped the
slide, you would be my wife to-day. I knew what I was
doing when I refused. And now you’re going to Los
Angeles, to be close to a man who loves you and can give
you what you think you want. Yet I refuse to neglect my
studies and throw myself into the work on my homestead,
which might convince you that I am at least willing to try
to earn for you what you want. Yes, Madge, I’ve already<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
given you up as a sacrifice to the stars. It has to be—I
must fulfill my destiny.”</p>

<p>“Fiddlesticks!”</p>

<p>Joshua Cole started to laugh, but checked himself as he
remembered the bewhiskered rifleman on the rocky shelf,
who for some reason had withheld his fire.</p>

<p>“Fiddlesticks, eh?”—and he smiled broadly. “Yes,
fiddlesticks, Madge. Fiddlesticks for you, because you don’t
mean what you say; you refuse to listen to your heart.
And fiddlesticks for me, because I know I haven’t given you
up except for now and the immediate future. Go to Los
Angeles. I’m willing that you should go. It may be for
the best—even if—even if you should marry Jack. But remember
what I told you up there when we finished the
building of the trail. You’ll come back to Spyglass Mountain.”</p>

<p>Sweet’s rifle rang out again, and then he walked from the
shelf, mounted his horse, and the little cavalcade filed away
in the direction they had come.</p>

<p>“I may as well tell you now, Joshua,” said Madge, just
a trace of haughtiness in her voice, “that I may <i>not</i> come
back. I’ll come back to the homestead, of course. But I
mean I may not come back to Spyglass Mountain in the
meaning that we have given that phrase.”</p>

<p>In reply Joshua only gave her his whimsical smile, and
she never knew how troubled was his soul.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXII<br>

<small>THE NIGHT OF JUNE FIFTEENTH</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ELIZABETH MUNDY and her daughter had gone
to the city on “the inside” of the range. Joshua
Cole moved about his little cabin with a listless air
when not wrapped up in his studies. Five days had passed
since he waved good-by to Madge as the six-horse stage took
up the long trip from Ragtown to the desert town of Spur.
Joshua was not going East. He had trailed down from the
summit of Spyglass Mountain one evening to find a vigorous
fire blazing at one corner of his cabin, and had heard the
thud of hoofs galloping off into the dusk. Five buckets of
water from the near-by well had saved his cabin and his
precious books and papers, but the owner now realized
that Sweet meant business and he dared not leave the
country. Even as Felix Wolfgang had planned.</p>

<p>The first time that Joshua rode to Ragtown for the mail
after Madge’s departure he encountered California Bill.
The two seated themselves in a remote corner of The Silver
Dollar, and Joshua told of the bullet holes in his cabin
roof, of one shattered window, of the fire of pitchy pine
splinters laid by horsemen who had galloped away into the
dusk, and of the rifleman on a shelf of Spyglass Mountain.</p>

<p>“And now,” he finished, “what’s your advice, old Bill?
I’ll respect it—even act on it—as I would the advice of no
other man I know.”</p>

<p>“Pin the medal here, Tony,” chuckled Bill, tapping his
broad breast with a stubby forefinger. “Pin ’er here, an’
listen to words o’ wisdom.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>“Shoot!”</p>

<p>“Do nothin’ but stick and watch yer prop’ty, an’ leave
th’ rest to that interestin’, quaint, an’ exclusive character
known as California Bill.”</p>

<p>“But, Bill, I don’t want to foist my troubles on you.
I’ll do the doing. I merely want advice.”</p>

<p>“An’ ye’ve got ’er, son—ye’ve got ’er. I’m th’ only
man in these here mountains that c’n handle this here deal.
Funny—but I am, seems. So it’s up to me to handle her.
I know Lee Sweet like I know my off lead mule, an’ it’s
a toss-up whichun’s the ornriest o’ th’ two. Lee’s th’
stubbornest, but th’ mule’s ears are th’ longest. Th’ mule’s
meaner than Lee Sweet, but Lee Sweet he thinks he’s th’
meanest. However, he thinks wrong. I’m s’prised at Lee.
Ye see, I know ’im so well. ’Tain’t like Lee a-tall to act
thataway. So, knowin’ that, I draw certain conclusions,
based on certain things I’ve witnessed here of late. So keep
ridin’ wide an’ pretty, Tony, an’ don’t strangle th’ biscuit—an’
leave th’ rest to me. How’s Shanty Madge makin’
out these days?”</p>

<p>Thus abruptly did California Bill close the matter of
Sweet’s persecution, intimating that he would attend to
everything and relieve Joshua of all worry.</p>

<p>“Why, didn’t you know?” Joshua returned. “She and
her mother have gone on the inside for a few weeks—to
visit the Montgomerys.”</p>

<p>“To visit th’ Montgomerys, eh?”—and the keen slate
eyes of the old freighter studied Joshua from under their
dense black <i>cheval-de-frise</i>. “Jack Montgomery in th’
mountains these days?”</p>

<p>“No, he’s still in the city.”</p>

<p>California intermittently separated and spread his thick
fingers on the table before him, watching the operation
thoughtfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>“Did ye ever ask Madge to marry ye, Tony?” he asked
suddenly.</p>

<p>Joshua’s face flamed red. “I—I— Come to think of it,
I don’t believe I ever did, Bill.”</p>

<p>Bill snorted softly and ceased his finger exercise to absently
toy with one of the fluffy little white rabbit tails that
puffed out above the lobe of each of his ears.</p>

<p>“You’re a hell of a lady’s man,” he observed disgustedly.
“Say, Tony, if ye let that dude of a Jack Montgomery get
Shanty Madge away from ye, I’ll—I’ll— I’m off ye f’r life,
that’s all! Maybe ye savvy Mars, but ye don’t know anything
about Venus. Ye’re loco in th’ head when it comes
to the <i>mujeres</i>.”</p>

<p>“I’ve let Madge see what I am,” Joshua said. “If she
wants me, she— Well, it’s up to her.”</p>

<p>“Up to her <i>my eye</i>! Ye gotta crowd ’em, <i>amigo</i>—ye
gotta crowd ’em right up ag’in th’ fence. They like it.”</p>

<p>“How do you know they do? You’re a great one to
talk.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve had my little spells o’ wranglin’ with ’em.
I’ll bet ye a strip o’ whang leather Jack Montgomery’s
crowded her.”</p>

<p>“He’s asked her to marry him, if that’s what you mean.”</p>

<p>“And she ain’t done it yet, has she? No, she ain’t.
An’ why? ’Cause she’s waitin’ for you to buck up an’ show
a little savvy. Say, Tony, ye make me sick as a drenched
mule.”</p>

<p>“I’ve tried to be a little dignified in the matter,” Joshua
defended.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell th’ cockeyed world ye have!” scoffed California
Bill. “Dignified! God! Who ever heard o’ love bein’
dignified? Say, that’s th’ best one I ever heard. Nobody
on earth but you could have sprung that, Tony. If there’s
anything on earth that <i>ain’t</i> dignified, it’s love. A man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
c’n get drunk an’ fall in a mud puddle, an’ get up an’
walk off dignified. A pallbearer might stub his toe an’
sprawl ’round till even the corpse laughed, but he’d be dignified
’longside a real he-man in love. Say, ye’re a reg’lar
howl!”</p>

<p>“It’s strange,” mused Joshua, a little stiffly, “that you
failed to call my attention to all this until Madge was out
of the mountains.”</p>

<p>“Hell’s afire, man!—I thought it was all settled between
you two long ago! I never dreamed ye was such a sucker!”</p>

<p>“She longs for money,” said Joshua. “She halfway
wants me to give up my astronomy, and I can’t do that.”</p>

<p>“Money my foot! What’d she buy with it? Mules? She
longs for love, and all she wants ye to give up is a little
love-talk.”</p>

<p>Joshua looked doubtfully at Bill, then down at the
table and blushed furiously.</p>

<p>“I’ve already called her dear twice,” he made announcement,
“and once I—I put my arm around her.”</p>

<p>California Bill roared and pounded the table with his
heavy fist. “<i>Muy bueno!</i>” he applauded. “<i>Hi-yu skookum!</i>
He called her dear twice! Oh, Lord! And once he
put his arm around her—seems! Sufferin’ snakes, Tony,
don’t ye know how funny ye are? Ye’re funny just like a
toad—who don’t know he’s funny a-tall!”</p>

<p>But Bill changed his tactics when he saw the brooding
look in Joshua’s eyes.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell ye what ye do,” he said, laying a stubby hand
on his friend’s shoulder. “You write Madge right away
an’ let her know it’s turned out ye dassent go East; an’ if
I’m not mistaken she’ll be lopin’ back soon’s she’s bought
her trinkets. An’ then if ye don’t start a riot with her—get
right down to business an’ make he-man love to her, th’
fightin’, faunchin’, rarin’, won’t-take-no-for-an-answer kind—why,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
then ye deserve to lose her. Now go on home an’
write to her so’s ye c’n get yer letter off to-morrow. I’m
plumb disgusted with ye—seems. Go on—an’ leave Lee
Sweet to a man that savvies men <i>and</i> women. Wait a
minute!... I’ll buy th’ drinks before ye go.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>California Bill continued to sit at the table long after
Joshua had ridden off on his dapple gray. He took a stiff
drink of whisky now and then for the good of his soul,
and rolled many brown-paper cigarettes. He kept his
sharp eyes on the ever-growing crowd before the bar, until
Lee Sweet, a little the worse for drink, staggered in with
three of his punchers behind him. Then Bill left the place
and went to The Golden Eagle.</p>

<p>In The Golden Eagle he lounged at the bar for a time,
talking with acquaintances, then found a table and sat
alone. His shrewd eyes roved frequently to Slim Wolfgang,
presiding over the stud game, his green-celluloid eyeshield
drawn low over his eyes, his coat off, displaying the sleeves
of a garish silk shirt, his billiard-cloth vest and golden
buttons making him as conspicuous as a parrot in a cage
of hawks.</p>

<p>Bill saw Slim’s girl when she danced with some heavy-footed
construction stiff, watched her while she hung over
Slim’s chair, or ogled some one to buy her a drink for the
good of the house and her own percentage.</p>

<p>California was thinking deeply. Old man-hunter that
he was, he was capable of putting two and two together, and
was not a stranger to the delicate art of deduction. Long
ago he had decided that no mere freak of chance had
brought The Whimperer and Slim Wolfgang to the country
where Joshua Cole was working. And now that Lee Sweet
had begun heckling the new homesteader, Bill was deeply
interested in the close companionship he had of late observed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
between Wolfgang, Sweet, and the girl called Winnie
the Weeper. Here was a mystery to be solved, and Bill
meant to solve it.</p>

<p>But he was unfortunate that night in that neither Winnie
the Weeper nor Slim Wolfgang made any move to join
Lee Sweet. And not once did the cattleman enter The
Golden Eagle. So Bill gave up his quest at midnight and
went to bed, for he must be up early and on his way to
Spur to continue his part in supplying the seemingly insatiable
wants of Demarest, Spruce and Tillou.</p>

<p>After that night, every time that California Bill made
Ragtown he watched for an opportunity to solve the mystery
of Felix Wolfgang’s sojourn there. He hoped to discover
the reason by stealing up on the gambler’s tent when
he and Winnie and Sweet were holding a conference. He
had rightly decided that Sweet was merely a tool in the
hands of the parasitical pair, that they were egging him on
to harass Joshua in order to serve their own mysterious
ends. Sweet he did not fear, for he considered him incapable
of any serious crime, a big, blustering, self-important
boy who merely needed a spanking.</p>

<p>Then it occurred to Bill that he was on the wrong tack
altogether, and he cursed himself for an idiot. If Winnie
and Wolfgang were working against Joshua through Lee
Sweet, Bill would learn nothing by listening in on a conversation
among the three. He must forget Sweet for the
time being, and make an effort to spy on the gambler and
his girl when they were alone.</p>

<p>So he took to loitering about the town until he saw
Winnie and Slim leave The Golden Eagle, when he would
steal up in the darkness and stand silent at the back of
their tent, with only the thin canvas between him and
them. Three times he did this, but he heard nothing to his
advantage. And these three times carried the actors in this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
little mountain drama well into the month of June, for each
of Bill’s trips to Spur occupied eight days.</p>

<p>Bill was learning nothing from his stealthy spying. He
had not once encountered Joshua during the month and a
half that followed Joshua’s tale of Sweet’s activities. So
he did not know whether Sweet had done anything more
against him or not. Sweet was busy with the cattle now,
for the spring drive into the mountains was on. Many
herds had already been brought in and were scattered over
the lush meadows, now rank with succulent feed. Sweet
and the greater portion of his vaqueros were on the desert
rounding up the stragglers over a range that extended
for ninety miles. California Bill was about discouraged
over the result of his efforts to help his friend when, on
the night of the fifteenth of June, he stood silent at the
back of Wolfgang’s tent and overheard conversation and
certain other sounds that made him cup a thick hand behind
his ear.</p>

<p>Because it was evident from what he heard that Slim
Wolfgang and Winnie the Weeper were packing their
trunks in readiness to take the stage for Spur next morning.
And Slim asked Winnie if she remembered what her
ticket from New York to California had cost.</p>

<p>This was sufficient to cause California Bill to clear for
action. He had found out nothing, and now this precious
pair were on their way East in the morning. There was
only one thing to be done before it was too late. Bill
stooped and softly began to pull the stakes from the ground
at one corner of the tent. A little later he gently lifted one
canvas wall, gave his body a quick flip, and was inside.</p>

<p>The girl sucked in a scream, turned chalk-white, and
stared at him. Slim Wolfgang wheeled from a trunk that
he was strapping, made a crawling dive for the table, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
wheeled again, half crouched, a Colt revolver leveled at
California Bill.</p>

<p>“Well, wot d’youse want in here?” he snarled.</p>

<p>“Son,” said Bill, “don’t point that there thing at me.
Put ’er on th’ table. I wanta talk to ye a bit.”</p>

<p>“Talk den, an’ make ’er snappy! Wot d’youse want
o’ me?”</p>

<p>“Lay th’ smoke-iron on th’ table, son,” Bill ordered
again. “What’s th’ use o’ yer flourishin’ ’er? Ye wouldn’t
dast shoot California Bill. They’d hang ye, come mornin’.
Be nice now—<i>an’</i> sensible.”</p>

<p>All the time that he was speaking California Bill had
been walking deliberately toward the gambler. His hands,
hanging at his sides, held no gun. Winnie the Weeper
shrank away from him as he neared her, backed to the bed,
and sat down weakly, her trembling legs unable to hold her
any longer. The slate-gray eyes of the old freighter were
fixed on the pale-blue eyes of Felix Wolfgang, and in them
was no unkindly light. But they held a fixity, an unwavering,
fearless, purposeful look that kept the gambler in a
statuesque attitude, undecided, deep down in his heart
afraid and hopeless. Slim had fought many battles, with
weapons and without, but always with tramps or gangsters
who feared him because of his cunning and his deadly
methods. Never before had an enemy walked straight up
to him, unarmed, and completely ignoring the menace of
his gun. It was new to Slim, and the cold fear gripped
him that, even if he should shoot, this calm, unconcerned
old Westerner would in the end come out the winner. And
Slim had much at stake. He did not know that those
hypnotic slate eyes of California Bill had brought many a
braver man than he was to surrender—that Bill was a fatalist,
and had faced many a threatening gun as he now faced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
this one, convinced that when his time came to die he
would simply die, and that would be the end of it.</p>

<p>“Wu-wot d’youse want, I’m astin’ youse?” Slim quavered,
as Bill stood within arm’s-length of him; and he was
surprised at the break in his voice and its lack of plug-ugly
huskiness.</p>

<p>“Why, that there gun, first,” replied California Bill;
and before Slim knew what had taken place the revolver had
been twisted from his hand and dropped into the freighter’s
pocket—but Slim’s wrist still ached.</p>

<p>“There—now that’s a heap better,” Bill said soothingly.
“Now le’s set on th’ bed—you an’ me an’ yer <i>muchacha</i>—an’
ye’re gonta tell me all about why ye’re here, an’ what
ye got ag’in my friend, Cole of Spyglass Mountain.”</p>

<p>“I—”</p>

<p>“Will,” complacently finished Bill, and his powerful
fingers suddenly grasped Slim’s already aching wrist.</p>

<p>Those stubby digits, thick as corncobs, closed down slowly
like a vise closing on a piece of wood.</p>

<p>“I c’n break ’er, son—jest as easy. Now gentle down an’
come to th’ bed with me. We’ll all set together, me in th’
middle, holdin’ onto both o’ ye friendly like; an’ we’ll talk
about Tony an’ yer trip out West.”</p>

<p>Winnie the Weeper half rose at this, and glanced about,
ready to dart out of the tent before Bill could drag her
<i>maquereau</i> to the bedside.</p>

<p>“Look, ma’am,” said Bill; and he flipped his right hand
downward as does a man who has had his hand in mud and
rids himself of it. And nestled in the palm of it the girl
saw a stubby .32 automatic pistol, which theretofore had
hung inside Bill’s sleeve, attached to a rubber band that
was bound about his elbow.</p>

<p>“I’m tellin’ ye frankly,” he drawled, “that yer man
couldn’t ’a’ shot me when I was walkin’ on ’im a minute<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
back. I coulda flipped this gun, dropped, and bored ’im
while his bullet was goin’ over my head. I coulda read in
his eye th’ instant he was gonta pull trigger—but that
look didn’t come there. I hate to brag, but this here case
is diff’rent. I’m workin’ for th’ best friend I got. Set
down, ma’am—tha-a-a-at’s right. Now, son—”</p>

<p>And he led the unprotesting gambler to the bed, back
upon which the girl had already sunk and was weeping
softly, and sat himself down between them, with a hand
gripping the wrist of each.</p>

<p>“Now we’re all <i>hi-yu skookum</i>,” he remarked jocularly.
“Let’s have th’ yarn from one end to t’other, an’ le’s don’t
make no mistakes.”</p>

<small>HORSEMEN IN THE NIGHT</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MEANWHILE Cole of Spyglass Mountain of days
had worked at fencing his claim or studying, and
of nights had kept vigil at the eye-piece of his telescope,
lost to this earth, his mind and soul transported to
other worlds all bright and peaceful.</p>

<p>Once as he walked up the trail to the observatory a
bullet had whizzed close to his head, followed by the distant
bark of a heavy firearm. And when Sweet’s vaqueros had
driven the first of the cattle into the mountains the herd
had stampeded Argo, at graze on his rope beside the lake,
and Joshua had scoured the country a week before he
found him. The gray had pulled his pin and raced away
in a frenzy of fright as the cowpunchers, with deliberate
intent, drove the cows upon him, yelling and firing into the
air.</p>

<p>These things worried Joshua, for it seemed next to impossible
for him to fight back. He could not have overtaken
the mounted cowboys on foot and fought it out with
them; and afterward he was unable to tell who had been
responsible because he knew none of Sweet’s men. Had he
carried a gun when fired upon as he climbed Spyglass
Mountain he would have been helpless to use it, since he
had gained no sight of the man who had shot toward him.</p>

<p>All this gave him a feeling of utter helplessness and dejection.
He harmed no man, wished no man ill. All he
wanted was to be allowed to go placidly on his way through
life, devoted to his studies, unobtrusive, simple, kindly, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
deep in his own affairs. Fight he would if the fight came
into the open, but he was unable to make it thus. He was
destined to be on the offensive so long as Sweet saw fit to
worry him, unless he went direct to Sweet and had it out
with him, face to face. And this he had about decided to
do when Madge’s letter came.</p>

<p>Madge had known when she left the country that he had
given up his Eastern trip because of Sweet’s firing on his
cabin from the shelf on Spyglass Mountain. So he had
not written her, as California Bill had advised. She had
gone on the twenty-seventh of April. Not a word had he
received from her in all those days, and often he had found
his mind wandering from the abstruse problems on his
home-made desk to her, down there in the city in “a swell
apartment.” Then came her letter, on the fourteenth of
June; and if his heart had been heavy before it turned to
a lump of clay as his moist eyes read her message:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Poet-Astronomer</span>:</p>

<p>“Many matters have prevented me from writing until now.
We’ve been so busy, and have had so much fun, that I am sure,
if you knew the half of it, you would forgive me. I’ve been
living, Joshua—living as I never lived before. Dances, automobile
rides, yachting off San Pedro and Coronado Beach, and
parties—parties—parties! And my new clothes, Joshua! Oh,
if you could only see me! Nothing expensive, of course—that is
out of the question. But they’re so pretty, and everybody flatters
me so that I’m afraid my head is a little turned.</p>

<p>“But all this means nothing to you, wrapped up as you are in
bigger things. I had to start this letter some way, though,
and work up to what I have to say. Joshua, it is going to hurt
you—what I have to tell you now. And I hate to hurt you. But
it is all for the best, I suppose, as Ma always told me when I
was a little girl.</p>

<p>“I know it will be better for you that I am going to marry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
Jack Montgomery. You and I never could be happy together,
dear boy, for the simple reason that you are too far above me—too
big for me in more ways than one. I am frivolous—more
frivolous than I knew throughout all the years on the railroad
grade. It took Los Angeles, with its brilliant throngs, dazzling
hotels, and everything that has given me pleasure to teach me
the shallowness of my nature.</p>

<p>“So, Joshua, I want you to forget me as unworthy of you.
You are a dreamer, with an unpractical mind far above the
sordid things that I find so interesting. You are young and will
soon forget me when you become a great astronomer, which I
am sure will happen some day. And then you can find a girl
who appreciates you. I am too shallow to do that.</p>

<p>“We haven’t decided what to do with the homestead yet. Ma
wants to go back the worst way, but of course Jack wouldn’t
approve of my returning for keeps, so, as I said, we are still
undecided just what to do. But, please, please, Joshua, forgive
me and try to forget me, for really I am not worth your notice.</p>

<p>“I don’t just know whether I love Jack or not, just between
you and me, and I shouldn’t be writing this to you about the
man I mean to marry. But I have written it, and I hate to
scratch things out, and am too lazy to begin my letter over
again. So I have written that I don’t know whether I’m in love
with him or not, and I’ll let it stand. Sometimes I think I am,
he’s so kind and considerate and—oh, so sort of buoyant and
happy-go-lucky, you know. And everybody likes him here. And
he’s really brilliant, Joshua. But all that aside, he can offer me
what I want in life, and I’m selfishly going to take it. Very
few girls marry for love these days. A couple who are congenial
can learn to like each other almost like love, and that’s what
most couples who are successful in marriage are doing nowadays.</p>

<p>“So this is good-by, Joshua, and you don’t know how it hurts
me to write it. It will hurt you, too, I know, but if you devote
yourself to your work—which I know you will do—you soon will
be laughing at yourself for ever thinking that you could tolerate
Shanty Madge as a wife. Good-by, then, my poet-astronomer.
And please forgive me. You know that I never, never encouraged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
you in the least. I knew better. I knew I was unworthy of
you. Don’t you understand? Write me a good long letter and
wish me well. How I wish I could be there on Spyglass Mountain
when the big night comes in June!</p>

<p>“Ma wants to be remembered to you, and says tell you she, at
least, will see you soon, provided you don’t go East before the
eighteenth—which I know you won’t. Well, good-by again, dear
Joshua. But I’m merely running around in circles. I’ve said all
that I have to say, and how I dreaded it. Good-by, then, dear
Joshua—and all the luck in the world. Oh, how I hate myself!
And, still it’s all for the best, I fully believe.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">“Contritely,</span><br>
“<span class="smcap">Madge</span>.”</p>
</div>

<p>In a dazed manner Joshua looked about his little cabin,
as if half-expecting to find Madge hiding somewhere there,
ready to step out and laughingly tell him it was all a
dream. But he saw only the dear, familiar objects of his
daily life—the walls lined with huge tough envelopes ten
inches by a foot in size, four tiers high, and filled to overflowing
with notes and clippings; his typewriter; his much-marked
books; his astronomical photographs above the
notes; the several benches covered with more notes still
unfiled; and in the other half of the room his cot, the stove,
and the table where he prepared his food and ate it. Slowly
he lowered his head and rested his chin on his breast, then
crossed his arms before him on his work and laid his head
upon them. He was tired, it seemed—only tired. And his
eyes ached. He had worked too hard that day.</p>

<p>And there, shortly after midnight, he fell asleep and
slept till morning called him to the woodpile and the daily
routine again.</p>

<p>He ate a little breakfast, and settled down at his desk
once more. But the printed words blurred before his eyes,
and his mind wandered from subjects that theretofore had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
held him spellbound. He arose and went outdoors, walked
for hours along the lake, moved Argo’s picket pin, then returned
to the cabin and chopped more wood. In this he
took a fierce delight, chopping, chopping, chopping all day
long, with only a little rest at noon.</p>

<p>At evening, just as the sun sank behind Saddle Mountain
and the gorgeous afterglow began to paint the waters
of the lake in impossible hues, he remembered something
and rested on the helve of his double-bitted ax. His mind
had been wandering back to his boyhood, to Silvanus Madmallet,
his mother and father, to Shanty Madge as he had
seen her in the skating rink and afterward in the gypo
camp—and then it was that he remembered Madge was
about the age of his brother Lester, and with a start recalled
the date. It was the fifteenth of June, Lester’s
birthday—and he would be twenty-one.</p>

<p>How had he remembered it in his stunned condition?
For stunned he seemed to be, stunned and bewitched by an
unfamiliar dullness. Why, thinking of Madge’s girlhood
had recalled it to his mind, of course. How stupid of him
to ask himself such questions, he who always reasoned logically,
from cause to effect, as a scientist should. He wondered
how Lester was getting on? Why hadn’t he answered
the several letters that he had written him?</p>

<p>Well, no matter. Lester was like all the rest—indifferent
to him and what befell him. He was hungry. He would
cook a bite and climb the trail to the observatory—for,
family outcast though he was, ex-inmate of a boys’ reformatory
where he had been imprisoned unjustly, tramp,
hounded by Lee Sweet, rejected by the girl he loved, he
still had a mistress who was always true to him, who
always rewarded his devotion; and the shrine where he
worshiped her was on the lofty summit of Spyglass Mountain.
And she could and would transport him to another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
world where, so far as man could see, everything was
steeped in brilliant white serenity. They might hammer
Joshua Cole to earth, but Cole of Spyglass Mountain was
consecrated to Science, and her he would serve to the bitter
end. And the great night was almost at hand. All
throughout the recent opposition of Mars to the earth he
had trained his refractor on that planet and sat immovable,
watching for the slightest indication of what he
longed to see. Mars was out of opposition now, and in
three nights more he would be nearer to the earth than
at any time since Joshua took up the study of astronomy.
Yes, he must eat a little to fortify himself against hours of
ceaseless concentration.</p>

<p>He ate hurriedly, forcing himself to swallow food that
he actually eschewed, then with his camera and other apparatus
set out upon the trail.</p>

<p>Slowly he climbed, winding in and out among the giant
rocks that studded the mountainside. Night had fallen
when he reached the summit and stood, breathing hard,
looking down on the desert, across which the shadow of the
mountains swiftly spread a black enveloping poncho. The
spring winds had ceased, and a stillness hung in the air
that to many would have proved depressing. High on the
pinnacle of this remote mountain he stood, and for once he
felt very much alone, like Hagar must have felt when she
was driven into the wilderness. But Hagar had her
Ishmael!</p>

<p>For a time he watched the desert as it was blotted out
before him. Then he turned and slowly entered the
observatory.</p>

<p>He lighted a coal-oil lamp, and climbed up on his ladder
to open the slit in the conical roof. Down again, he placed
the lamp so that it would be behind him during his observation.
By pulling a cord he moved the revolving roof<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
until the refractor was pointing through the slit. Then he
moved the ladder behind the eye-piece and climbed high
upon it, for Mars was not far above the horizon. He placed
his eye to the finder and moved the delicately adjusted
instrument until he found the image. Next he clambered
down and started the driving clock which caused the telescope
to follow the object in its course across the sky for
two hours and a half. He climbed the ladder again and
took his seat, with his head only a few feet from the roof;
and, as the eye-piece was already in focus, he began searching
the surface of the planet for the region central to
Uranius, Nilokeras, and Ganges, moving the instrument
slowly.</p>

<p>And there he sat through the unbroken quietude of several
hours, his steady, far-seeing right eye fixed on the
glowing surface of the distant ball of soft white fire. The
atmosphere was remarkably clear to-night, and the planet
at times threw off a glow that heightened its brilliancy and
dazzled his eye, and then the glow would subside and well-known
markings would stand out clearly for an instant.
But he gained not even a fleeting glimpse of the figure that
he fancied he had seen before, and upon which he had
based his hopes of writing his name indelibly on the scientific
roster.</p>

<p>How long he had been on watch through the eternal stillness
of Spyglass Mountain he did not know, when of a
sudden he heard the thud of hoofs outside the observatory.
He felt a quick stab of apprehension. He was unarmed.
Was it Sweet?</p>

<p>But a familiar voice now called:</p>

<p>“Hey! Tony! Are ye in there? This is California
Bill!”</p>

<p>“Yes!” answered Joshua, with a feeling of vast relief.
“What on earth are you doing up here this time o’ night?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>“I’ll show ye in a minute,” answered Bill; and then
Joshua heard him speak in a lower tone to some one else.</p>

<p>Joshua climbed down from his ladder, loath to leave the
eye-piece of the refractor, and opened the door. In came
a man whose little pale-blue eyes darted a glance of supreme
hatred at him, and then were lowered instantly.
California Bill brought up the rear.</p>

<p>“Hello, Cole of Spyglass Mountain,” was his greeting.
“I’ve brung a—a <i>thing</i> to see ye to-night, an’ it’s got a
tale to tell. Kick them boxes over here so’s we c’n all set
down together. Slim Wolfgang he’s gonta talk.”</p>

<p>Deeply mystified, Joshua obeyed and distributed the
boxes over the unfloored ground.</p>

<p>“Set down, Slim,” softly ordered California Bill.
“You, too, Tony. I’ll take this’n’, right next th’ door.
Now, Tony, get ready for the hardest jolt that ever hit ye.
I’ll hand it to ye first, an’ Slim here c’n tell ye th’ rest
afterwards. This man, Tony—this thing, I mean—has
helped to rob ye of a fortune amountin’ to a hundred and
fifty thousan’ dollars. If we’d ’a’ known about it less’n
a week ago we coulda saved ’er for ye. But to-night’s th’
last night f’r ye to claim it. An’ we’re ’way out in California,
on top o’ Spyglass Mountain, while yer money’s
back on th’ Atlantic, three thousan’ miles away. That’s
th’ devilish end o’ th’ thing. Now Slim Wolfgang’s gonta
tell ye th’ first of it. Start yer voice, Wolfgang.”</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXIV<br>

<small>WHEN THE MOMENT CAME</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AND so under the commanding eyes of California Bill
the sordid story was told again—the story of a
father’s avarice and his hatred for his firstborn, the
story of a brother’s treachery, the story of the fortune that
Cole of Spyglass Mountain had lost that very night.</p>

<p>Joshua sat white-faced and listened, while Mars traveled
on its endless orbit, with the faithful telescope, unheeded
by its master, slowly following it like a human finger.</p>

<p>Bill rose as the story reached an end. Slim Wolfgang
sat, with head bowed forward, his long fingers interfretted
and working nervously. Bill laid a hand along the shoulder
of the astronomer, and the stubby fingers patted Joshua’s
coat.</p>

<p>“It’s hell,” he said—“plumb hell! But it can’t be
helped, and we’re gonta take it like a man. Ain’t we,
Tony? Maybe it ain’t too late. Maybe ye c’n do somethin’
to prove fraud an’ get th’ money after all. You’n’ me’ll
talk that over when we’ve disposed of th’ body. Now le’s
go out an’ keep this bird inside, while we figger out th’
most horrible way to torture ’im.”</p>

<p>Joshua rose in the same daze that had wandered with
him all that day. He laughed shortly as the door closed
behind him. Then he laughed louder and louder, and the
tears streamed down his face.</p>

<p>“When do I wake up?” he cried at last, still laughing
hysterically. “This isn’t true, Bill. It’s all a dream.
I know it. So many things couldn’t happen to a fellow all
at once.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>Bill patted his shoulder again. “She’s true, son—dam’
true,” he told him.</p>

<p>Then Bill shook him as he renewed his laughter—shook
him until the breath had left him, and he sat down weakly
on a piñon stump.</p>

<p>“Thing is,” said Bill, “what’ll we do with Wolfgang?”</p>

<p>For a long time Joshua was silent, as gradually the
realization of what had taken place crept into his befuddled
mind.</p>

<p>“What can we do?” he asked simply.</p>

<p>“That’s up to you,” Bill told him. “Whatever you say
goes with me. I’d turn my back, I guess, while ye cut his
throat.”</p>

<p>For fully five minutes not another word passed between
the two. Then Joshua rose to his feet with a long sigh.</p>

<p>“I’ve thought it all out, Bill,” he announced, “and
there’s nothing that I can do. I’ll simply let him go—that’s
all. I’ll tell you, Bill: When a fellow has for years
devoted his soul to study of the fundamental things of
life, everything else seems puny. Look through that refractor
for an hour and you’ll get the feeling, too. When
you begin to realize the vastness of the universe, and know
that beyond the one in which we live lie countless other
universes as stupendous or even more stupendous than this
one, you—you begin to realize that you are like a tiny straw
in the wind—that your little difficulties, disappointments
and fruitless struggles on this insignificant ball of stones
and earth are not worthy of a moment’s thought. Slim
Wolfgang has been the means of robbing me of the girl I
love. If I had fallen heir to that money— Well, you
remember what I told you about Madge. And now I have
nothing left but my work. I’ll wrap myself up in it soul
and body—and forget. So I have no time to bother about
Slim Wolfgang. Open the door and let him go.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>“But, Tony—”</p>

<p>“You don’t understand, Bill. I can never make you
understand. So you must just take my word for it that to
revenge myself on Wolfgang would give me no satisfaction
at all. I have not fully realized until to-night that I have
not been truly devoted to my science. I have allowed other
interests to claim a part of my time and my thoughts. And
all this has come upon me at once to prove the old adage
that Science is a jealous mistress, and will brook no rivals.
I have learned my lesson. I can’t have money; I can’t even
have relatives; I can’t have any other work to claim my
time; I can’t have love. And if all these things must be
denied me because I have consecrated myself to Science,
what time have I for the petty satisfaction a man would
get from revenging himself on an insignificant fellow stumbler
on this insignificant earth? No, Bill—I’ve lived in
other worlds too much to descend to that. Open the door
and let Slim Wolfgang be on his way.”</p>

<p>“Tony, I’m ord’narily a peaceful man myself,” Bill responded.
“You know that ’thout me tellin’ ye. But to-night
I’m mad. To-night I don’t know what I couldn’t do
to that pimp in there. An’—”</p>

<p>“But you haven’t been looking at Mars for perhaps
three hours,” Joshua reminded him. “Bill, you can never
understand. Let him out, and let him get on his horse and
go. But you stay a little. I’m kind of lonesome, I find.
You’ll enjoy looking at Mars just now, for he’s very close
to the earth. Look for ten minutes, then maybe you’ll
understand me better. Maybe I’m a visionary fool, but
Mars will help you to decide on that. And—and I’d like to
talk with you a little after he’s gone.”</p>

<p>California Bill rose briskly to his feet. “You’re th’
doctor,” he said. “An’ I’ve always found ye sensible.”
He opened the door. “Come out here, Wolfgang,” he ordered.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
“Ye get only a dishonorable discharge from these
here mountains that ye been stinkin’ up too long.”</p>

<p>Wolfgang came out hesitatingly, and Bill led forward
the borrowed horse that he had ridden.</p>

<p>Bill stood beside him as he set a foot in the stirrup to
mount, and then he ordered:</p>

<p>“Don’t move, fella. Keep that position till I think a
minute.”</p>

<p>The gambler did as he was bidden, for his wrist still
ached.</p>

<p>Then suddenly Bill drew back his right foot for a vigorous
kick—a kick of supreme contempt, about the greatest insult
the West can offer. He lowered the foot, drew it back
again. And then once more both feet were stationary on
the ground.</p>

<p>“No,” he said thoughtfully, “ye’re right, Tony. What’s
th’ use? Go on, Slim! Get on that <i>caballo</i> an’ beat it fast
as ye c’n ramble. Keep goin’ an’ goin’ an’ goin’, an’ never
come West ag’in. Tony an’ me, we’re goin’ in an’ look at
Mars. We’re men, we are—we’re big. We got no time to
fool with you. Beat it, fella, before I change my mind an’
kick th’ stuffin’ outa ye jes’ f’r luck.”</p>

<p>For several minutes the two friends listened in silence
to the click of Wolfgang’s mount as it stumbled down the
rocky trail. Then all was still again, and they turned and
entered the observatory.</p>

<p>“Tony,” Bill began.</p>

<p>But Joshua interrupted: “Not a word about the money,
Bill, please. I want to forget it altogether. I <i>must</i> forget
it.”</p>

<p>“I was gonta talk about Lee Sweet and Madge,” the
freighter explained. “Lee Sweet, as Wolfgang told ye, he’s
only tryin’ to scare ye into desertin’ yer claim. He ain’t
any murderer. But when he gets drunk he may do somethin’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
he don’t aim to; so I’m gonta get after ’im right
away an’ let ’im know what a fool this gambler made o’
’im. An’ tell ’im we’re onto ’im, an’ if he don’t be good
we’ll spank ’im. I’m gonta take a few days off—I know
a fella that’ll take the team for me—an’ go hunt Lee Sweet
up. I know about where to locate ’im up th’ range, where
he’s still roundin’ up stragglers an’ cows that’ve drifted
into the mountains farther south. I want ye to be feelin’
fine for th’ night o’ th’ eighteenth, Tony, an’ have no
worries on yer mind. ’Cause I got th’ feelin’, from what
ye’ve told me, ye’re gonta be steppin’ high that night, an’
ye’re gonta nail ole Mars to th’ tree. So don’t fret about
Lee Sweet. I’m goin’ after ’im, an’ see that he ain’t here
to bother ye between now an’ then. And now about
Madge. Don’t ye think for a minute—”</p>

<p>“Here—read this,” offered Joshua, and passed him
Madge’s letter.</p>

<p>Bill put on his old steel-rimmed spectacles and leaned
toward the light. He read the letter through twice, then
handed it back.</p>

<p>“Well, le’s have a squint at ole Mars,” he suggested,
“an’ then I’ll be on my way. I’ll get a saddle hoss to-morrow
an’ ride Sweet down, an’—”</p>

<p>“But what do you think about Madge’s letter?” Joshua
asked.</p>

<p>“I think somebody else needs spankin’,” said California
Bill. “An’ it’s up to me to ’tend to that—seems. What
do I do? Climb that confoun’ ladder?”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>California Bill had not been in the saddle more than a
few hours for several years. He was a prey to misgivings
when he rode out of Ragtown the following morning on his
way to Box-R Ranch. He reached the ranch shortly after
dinnertime, and was told, as he had expected, that Sweet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
was to the south hunting drifters. So he set off over the
desert, following the foothills, hoping to come upon the
cattleman before nightfall.</p>

<p>In the middle of the afternoon he came upon a small
herd being driven to the foot of the G-string road, but
Sweet was not among the men who drove them. They
knew that he was working farther to the south, but could
not tell Bill just where to find him. So he changed position
in the saddle and loped away once more, and by night had
reached Gonzales Wells without having seen another living
soul.</p>

<p>There was a station at the wells where desert travelers
were housed and fed, and Bill dragged himself to a hard
couch in the loft that night. Next morning he was undecided,
but, having come so far, he determined to keep on.
Surely he would meet up with Sweet that day. But noon
overtook him before he had ridden to Seven Palms, another
station, and he had not seen Sweet.</p>

<p>Here, however, he learned that in all likelihood Sweet
had gone into the mountains with such cows as had been
rounded up in that locality. It was possible, he was told,
for Sweet to drive the stragglers along the ridges to the
vicinity of Ragtown without coming down to the desert.
This, it was suggested, was what he might do, in the hope of
picking up on his way any drifting stock that had already
sought the green meadows of the highlands. And Bill was
advised to retrace his course rather than try the mountains
over trails with which he was not familiar.</p>

<p>With the morose feeling that he had once more failed
to aid his friend and protégé, the old freighter, saddle-weary
and disappointed, rode back. He rode hard, for fear
that Sweet would reach Ragtown over the mountain route
ahead of him, get drunk, and worry Joshua at what Bill
firmly believed to be the biggest moment in the young astronomer’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
life. He reached Box-R Ranch in the course of
time, and, not daring to rest, set out that same night for the
summit.</p>

<p>So stiff he could scarce climb from the saddle, he drew
rein before The Silver Dollar near midnight, to find the
regular revel in full swing. A little questioning soon
brought to light the information that Lee Sweet had
reached Ragtown early in the afternoon with three of his
vaqueros, had got gloriously drunk, and had ridden off,
whooping and firing into the air, not twenty minutes before
Bill’s arrival. Bill changed horses and dragged his tired
body into the saddle again. And fearing the worst—for
it was the eighteenth of June—he raced around the lake to
Joshua’s homestead and clattered into the trail that led to
the summit of Spyglass Mountain.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The eighteenth of June—with Mars riding the heavens
only forty-two million miles away! Only forty-two million!—yet
by the end of August the distance would be increased
to sixty-six million miles!</p>

<p>Midnight—with Cole of Spyglass Mountain seated high
up on his ladder, his far-seeing blue-gray eye glued to the
powerful five-hundred-diameter eye-piece of his telescope.
Unnoticeably the refractor followed the planet in its endless
flight. The driving clock purred softly, the only sound
on Spyglass Mountain, for the night was still as death
itself—cold and still and fraught with an uncanny tensity.</p>

<p>Shanty Madge was forgotten. John Cole and Lester
Cole and the legacy left by Peter Henry Florence were
forgotten. Lee Sweet and his boisterous vaqueros were forgotten.
For Cole of Spyglass Mountain nothing existed in
the universe save romantic Mars, riding the sky on his
mysterious rounds.</p>

<p>For hours he had watched, but there came no sign. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
glowing planet looked as it had always looked when close to
the earth. Once he imagined he saw a threadlike tracery,
but it instantly was gone, and a heavy sigh escaped him.
The strain was stultifying, and few observers could have
withstood the ordeal that Cole withstood that night.</p>

<p>With another heavy sigh he withdrew his eye from the
eye-piece to rest it, and glanced at the little alarm clock
on the opposite wall. He could barely see its yellow face
in the dim light cast by the coal-oil lamp, but he blinked his
eyes several times, closed them tightly, opened them again,
and noted that it was ten minutes after twelve.</p>

<p>He waited a moment, then placed his eye to the eye-piece
once more.</p>

<p>And then he sucked in his breath in wonder. The atmosphere
had grown suddenly clearer, it seemed, or else the rest
had benefited his eyesight. A low cry burst from his lips.
For there before him, very faint but unmistakable, stood
the hairlike lines of the figure he had longed for years to
see again.</p>

<p>Was he insane? Had he looked too long? Was his mind
wrought up to such a pitch that it was grasping at an
optical illusion?</p>

<p>His camera and the color screen! That would prove
whether or not his eyesight had betrayed him. Almost beside
himself with eagerness, he clattered down the ladder,
got his camera and the screen, and clambered to the top
again.</p>

<p>Then a shot rang out, and he heard the thud of a bullet
as it struck the metal dome.</p>

<p>Lee Sweet again! Or some of his men! No matter.
No time now to think of them!</p>

<p>Again came a shot and a thud above him. The rifleman
was shooting high in an effort to frighten him, thinking
him on the floor and safe from harm. Well, he was not on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
the floor. He was high up in the dome, in the direct line of
the bullets. Let them fire! What mattered it? He had
seen the configuration on Mars which was to make him
famous. That, or he had lost his reason. What mattered
it? Let them shoot!</p>

<p>There came a fusillade of shots, and the dome rattled.
Again and again it was repeated, and all the time Cole of
Spyglass Mountain was setting up his camera and adjusting
the color screen to photograph the strange hairlike figure
he had seen.</p>

<p>He stepped one side on the ladder, at last ready to press
the bulb. Another shower of bullets rattled against the
dome, followed by a single shot and a lusty yell. Then
before he could press the bulb everything went black, and
Cole of Spyglass Mountain swayed and tumbled down the
ladder, dragging his camera after him.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>About three weeks later a maid presented herself before
Madge Mundy in the Montgomerys’ apartment in Los Angeles.</p>

<p>“There’s a man to see you at the door, miss,” she announced.
“He has no card, and he won’t come in. He
says he’s from Ragtown and has an important message for
you.”</p>

<p>“I’ll see him,” said Madge, a strange feeling of faintness
coming over her.</p>

<p>At the door she found California Bill, holding in his
short hand an open-face silver watch of large proportions.</p>

<p>“Hello, Shanty Madge,” he greeted her. “I come to tell
ye that Tony’s gettin’ pretty low. He’s in th’ hospital at
Ragtown, an’ I hadta go clean to Spur to get a decent
doctor. He’s pretty well shot up in the upper works, an’
he won’t fight back—seems. After Lee Sweet shot ’im—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>“After what?” Madge’s head was swimming and her
hand grasped the door-frame.</p>

<p>“Yes’m—after that ornery beef critter shot ’im he went
out f’r a time, an’ then he come back a-ravin’ about what
he’d seen on Mars. An’ nothin’ would do but I had to go
to Spur that night an’ send a telegram to Milton University.
I done it, o’ course—seein’ his well-bein’ depended
on it. Ye see, Lee an’ some o’ his buckeroos was all lit up
an’ jes’ aimin’ to scare Tony. An’ they shot high, thinkin’
Tony was on th’ ground. But Tony’s up on his ladder
squintin’ at ole Mars. An’ now Lee’s th’ scaredest man in
all that country. I’ll read ye what Tony told me to write,
so’s I could turn it over to th’ operator at Spur.”</p>

<p>Madge gazed at the old freighter while he fumbled in
his pocket and finally produced a piece of dirty paper. He
placed his steel-rimmed glasses on his nose and read haltingly:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dr. Hiram A. Buck</span>,<br>
Director Observatory,<br>
Milton University,<br>
Elmfield, Massachusetts.</p>

<p>“Observed at thirteenth hour thirteenth minute June eighteenth
with eight-inch refractor singular geometrical configuration on
Mars. Latitude seventy degrees; longitude plus twenty degrees.
Central to Uranius, Nilokeras, and Ganges. Appeared to be circle
with straight line south and tangent to circumference. Very
faint. Please wire my expense if larger instruments confirm
reality of object.”</p>
</div>

<p>Bill looked up into the reddish-brown eyes of the little
gypo queen, who stood bent forward, lips parted and dry.</p>

<p>“That’s what I sent,” Bill went on, “an’ Tony seemed
to be gettin’ better for a spell. He wouldn’t hear o’ me
comin’ down here to th’ city to see you, so I hadta stay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
beside ’im. Then one day come a reply, an’ I got a copy
o’ that here to show ye, too.”</p>

<p>He produced a strip of paper, from which he read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Configuration mentioned not observed from this station. Later
reports will follow.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Buck.</span>”</p>
</div>

<p>“An’ then eight days went by, with Tony fussin’ an’
fussin’ an’ fussin’ all th’ time, an’ then come this.”</p>

<p>Again Bill read from the same source:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In further reference configuration seen by you June eighteenth
no reports received from other stations.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Buck.</span>”</p>
</div>

<p>“An’ after that,” continued Bill, “Tony he give up th’
fight. Ye see,” he added with piteous earnestness, “Tony
he got shot before he could take a picture, an’ he ain’t got
any proof. An’ he’s out of his head now, ravin’ mad, an’
sayin’ over an’ over again:</p>

<p>“‘You’ll come back to Spyglass Mountain, Madge, ’cause
ye’re big like th’ great-hearted trees. Yes, you’ll come back
to Spyglass Mountain, dear.’</p>

<p>“An’ th’ doc says,” Bill concluded, “that Tony won’t
pull through if ye don’t come back. He’s dyin’—seems—don’t
care to live. I got one o’ them buckin’ broncho taxi-things
down in th’ street, rarin’ an’ snortin’ to go, Madge.
Train leaves f’r Spur in forty minutes by this here ole
watch o’ mine. Connects with th’ stage to Ragtown. I’ll
trot down an’ throw a little <i>muck-a-muck</i> into me while
ye’re puttin’ on yer hat an’ things. Be waitin’ f’r ye on
th’ sidewalk, Madge.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>Another week had passed. In the little pine hospital at
Ragtown Cole of Spyglass Mountain lay on a neat white
bed, and a girl with bronze-gold hair bent over him. Dr.
J. Miles Stanhope moved about shakily, drunk as usual, but
with kindliness written all over his features. Also the
doctor from Spur was there; and at one side sat California
Bill.</p>

<p>The silent, bandaged figure moved on the bed and softly
moaned. The doctor from Spur nodded to Madge, who
bent down lower and began once more the words which
she had repeated a hundred times since she reached the
hospital. And as had been the case each time before, the
hot tears wet her cheeks.</p>

<p>“I’ve come back, Joshua! Joshua—it’s Madge speaking
to you. Oh, Joshua, I’ve come back to you! It’s Madge—Shanty
Madge. Listen, Joshua—I’ve come back to you.
Shanty Madge is back! I’ve come back to Spyglass Mountain!”</p>

<p>And now, for the first time in all those tense days, the
dark-gray eyes opened wide and stared up into the Spanish-topaz
eyes above them. Then, shaking like an aspen, Shanty
Madge bent low and whispered:</p>

<p>“I’ve come back to you, Joshua—back to Spyglass Mountain!”</p>

<p>A moment longer the puzzled gray-blue eyes studied the
wet face of the girl, and the blended pink and tan of the
Pocahontas cheeks brought recognition. Madge bent lower
still and kissed the broad smooth forehead. A childlike
smile crossed Joshua’s clean-cut lips.</p>

<p>“Then,” said his voice, very faint, “I’ll—I guess I’ll get
well, after all.”</p>

<p>Five days later the stage from Spur arrived, and Bill
left Madge and Joshua, now fully conscious and on the
mend—according to the doctor—while he went to the post<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
office for the mail. He hurried back presently, a sheaf of
yellow envelopes in his hand.</p>

<p>“Only th’ first-class mail’s distributed,” he announced.
“An’ looky what I got! Telegrams, Tony—telegrams by
the dozen! Read ’em. Somethin’s broke!”</p>

<p>Eagerly Joshua grasped the first and tore it open, to
read in absolute amazement:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Congratulations from Dr. Ernest G. Pratt, of Tabor University.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Ernest G. Pratt.</span>”</p>
</div>

<p>“What’s this? What’s this?” cried Bill.</p>

<p>But Joshua was tearing another envelope.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Sanborn, Ohio.</span></p>

<p>“Greatest discovery in many years. Please accept my hearty
congratulations.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Dr. John F. Quincy, M. S.</span>”</p>
</div>

<p>And the next:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It gives me great pleasure to offer my sincere congratulations
and thanks for your recent contribution to the knowledge of the
world.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Professor Harvey G. Mills.</span>”</p>
</div>

<p>“Why, what’s it all about?” cried Joshua, a pink glow
in his hollow cheeks.</p>

<p>But before any one could puzzle out an answer Dr. J.
Miles Stanhope burst in, his cheeks purple with excitement,
and thrust before the group a belated Sunday paper. And
there in headlines that crossed the page, Joshua read as if
in a rapturous dream:</p>

<p>“Oh, Joshua,” cried Madge, “it’s true! It’s true! It’s
true! Oh, my dear—I’m happier than you are. I know I
am! It means more to us than all the money in the world!”</p>

<p>And, muttering crossly to himself, he stalked out and
left behind two silent figures, whose tear-streaked faces were
pressed together, with the paper propped up before them
on the bed.</p>
